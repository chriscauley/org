  "Here you are," Roy declared angrily entering Kelly's room. `Tell me something I don't know` Kelly thought sarcastically. Roy's face krinkled as if he heard her. `Impressive`, Kelly mused, `not many <<humans are clever enough to monitor others thought bands>> so casually`. A red light pulsed in the corner of her eye. Her nanny AI decided this statement was too much information for a flesh type to hear. Kelly brushed away the warning without checking the new text the AI recorded instead of vher own. Roy continued, verbally, as most humans prefer. "I've been searching the ship for you. Funny how your room was some how the last place to look. Why have you been spending so much time offline?"

  Kelly pulled up the logs of people who had been trying to reach her. She found dozens of messages and hundreds of location pings sent by Roy over the past hour. Two of the messages were marked *Persistent little man*, she thought internally, *still, pretty impressive that he defeated my sub routines to trick people into looking everywhere else but my room*. She put down the [tab] in front of her and turned to him. "I've been busy. I still am busy, what do you need?"

[tab] <!-- love it! is it a browser tab, tablet, or some other object? technology should be obfuscated -->

  He spoke with the nervous, assertive-yet-terrified tone of a nerd who needed to ask but was afraid to. "You're not donating your share of comp-time to my [landing program]. We agreed that everyone would chip in a percent to my simulations in order to get the trajectory figured out in time!"

[landing program] <!-- this is shit, do something better, maybe randomness? Maybe writting a program instead of comp power. Pick something lame but necessary. -->

  Kelly met his gaze intently. "I'm the number one donator," she declared, checking the numbers against her records. She had a sophistry AI set up to win arguments like these. She wasn't proud of it but she was glad to see it put to use. "In fact I'm donating roughly a ten percent of your total pool, which is three times more than you are contributing."

  'Stop equivocating, you fallacious bitch!' is what he should have said, if he had a spine. Instead he said, "Yes, but the agreement was a percentage of YOUR pool should be donated. For some reason you've amased the largest comp pool of anyone on the ship. But as important as your work is, [landing this ship] is a computational nightmare. Everyone agreed to help me with this and you aren't holding up your end."

[landing this ship] <!-- :( -->

  Kelly shot him a look of bemused dissappointment.
