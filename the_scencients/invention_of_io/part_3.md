Part 3: The suicide note of Colonel Johnathan Handy

Today I was called to a briefing about a "man from the sky". At first I thought it must be a code word or a joke of some sort. Even three quarters through I still couldn't believe it. It must be a drill, I said over and over again. But the look on chiefs face was that of sheer terror.

When the marines entered the space ship it lit up. More conservative voices insisted we keep the craft on earth and study it, but even the fastest terrestrial space craft would take months to get to Saturn. The schematics on the craft claimed that it could hold a continuous 1 g accelleration, which would take less than a week in total time to get the marines to Io. They charted a flight plan and left for Jupiter. Shortly after leaving the ship took over and ramped them up to an accelleration of 3 g, terifying the crew but getting them there in almost no time.
