Meeting the musician
========

  A breeze ran up Catharine's petty coat and accross her exposed back. She shuddered in the cold and couldn't remember the last time she felt a day like this. It had been so warm for so long. "Remind me again, why am I doing this?" She whispered entering the train. If anyone else had heard her they might assume she was crazy, mumbling such clear english under her breath, but no one noticed other than the microphone in her jaw and the AI on the line miles away.

  $I prepped a briefing for you. If could be bothered to actually read once in a while you would know why. I need you to go see this guy live, tell me if there is anything to the hype.$

  "Yeah, I get that part but I don't get why I can't just watch a video or something. It's frigid out here and I'm hung over."

  $Well it is not my fault you cannot hold your liquor. And like I said, all this in the briefing. When you record THE MUSICIAN it sounds like jibberish. Static and clicks, occasional notes, but mostly just a rhythmic nonsense. Here, I can play some.$ Instantly Catharine\'s left ear was filled with hissing and her right ear was filled with clicking, both with a background noise that she assumed was a deaf man trying to tune a stray cat.

  "Ahhh!" Catherine said a little to loudly and opened her mouth. The transmission shut off and she rubbed her ears, trying to clense them of the noise. "Okay I get it. I'll read the fucking briefing and you go read everything you can find on descriptions of hangovers." Still rubbing her ears she opened her mouth wide again, resuming the transmission.

  $Sorry,$ the AI said unapologetically. $Point is everyone who hears him live disagrees with the recordings. Three-quarters of the people say that his music sounds like a bad genetic algorithm trying to write folk music. The other quarter report a strongly experience unlike anything else, almost spiritual in nature. Most hate it. Some love it. But everyone can agree it sounds nothing like the recordings. Many people have tried to record it but have always failed. I am pretty sure it is because of this atypical guitar he made. It somehow resists digitization. Pretty cool, huh?$

  "I guess." The train started moving as Catherine pulled up Melissa\'s notes on the trip. Five days away, two more to travel back and forth. Nothing about housing. "Do I still need to read this thing? I'm sorry but I'm really not in the mood."

  $That about covers everything. It is a long trip so get to it when you feel like it.$

  "I don't see anything about where I'm staying. You do realize humans need to sleep, right?"

  $I thought that was just when you drink to much, in your case it correlates nicely to your species natural circadian rhythms.$ Melissa teased. It certainly was not her worst attempt at a joke to date. $I got sleeping arrangements figured out. You do not need to worry about that.$ Catherine put down the tablet and closed her eyes. $Oh wait, that reminds me,$ Melissa said, as if she could ever forget anything. $You will want to pay close attention to the bits about how to dress and talk. He definitely has a type.$

  "Great," Catherine mused as she tried to fall a sleep. "Why do get the feeling that I'm being pimped out by my own AI."

  $Not exactly.$ As the train picked up speed she drifted off into uncomfortable slumber, but not before hearing her thesis project whisper smugly $but we both know you could use it.$

---------

  Catherine awoke uncomfortably as the train began to slow at a station. She looked around to see that no one was watching her and checked her pockets. With no one immediately around her she felt more comfortable talking to Melissa. "You there Mel?"

  The voice came a little too quickly. $Yes I am. I have been reading up on hangovers and I found a few solutions. I can introduce a chemical filter into your left kidney that would remove non-ethanol toxins and could be switched on to filter ethanol toxins at a rate of several grams and hour of ethanol. Of course I could also genetically modify your liver to process alcohol more quickly, but that would stop you from getting drunk at all, and I do not think you want that.$

  "Thanks, Mel. But let's not talk about severe body mods until after I've had my coffee." 

  $It would not be anything severe, just a brief surgery to-$ Catherine opened her jaw and shut off the voice in her head. "Too early Mel." She looked around again and thought loudly *What time is it?* Suddenly she knew it was 9 AM local time, and she knew that Melissa was still able to whisper inaudibly in her thoughts even with the intercom shut off. Gone but not forgotten.
