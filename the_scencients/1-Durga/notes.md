Notes for book 1
========

## This book takes place entirely on Reality TV

The constant problem I run into is how do I reconcile the timescales of space travel with the timescales of Moores law. I want the space travel of 200 years from now and the computers of 20 years from now in the same story. This is accomplished by two factors: Io perverting the timeline and Reality TV.

When Io wanders back in time he moves not exactly back in time but a tangential spot on the time plane. From the perspective of the people in the time plane a being from the future showed up and dropped them off technology. This gives them the computers, engineering, and physics of 50 years in the future and stunts their growth (if you gave cave men lighters it would take them longer to figure out how to light fires on their own). They are children driving the chariots of the gods around the solar system and using a smart phone without being able to unlock it (flashlight and camera with no ability to gather pictures).

But this does not explain the massive engineering projects (Martian colony, Venus temperature/pressure reduction, solar platforms) which these children seem to accomplish. But they exist the same way that the base at Io exists in book 1. When Io traveled back into the past (at an odd angle on the time plane) he creates a bastardized past. Just as the base at Io is not fully unwritten, the engineering projects of the past cannot be unwritten because (spoiled with future tech) the humans do not know how to create them.

But this sounds very familiar: people living in an artificial past, built on a layer of contemporary technology that the humans are not allowed to touch. This describes Reality TV, or at least it does from the perspective of the humans not aware that they are on a TV show (which actually represents some 95% of the people on Reality TV post detonation of Jupiter). The events of part I are happening at the same time, on the same earth, just 30 years normal on the time plane, to the events of books 4 and 5. The rest of this book happen after the events of the 6th book, which takes place over a timespan of less than a year.

The venus colony is a failed attempt at raising humans on the surface. A massive terraforming effort is already underway which has significantly decreased the temperature and pressure of the planet. This is actually ~40-60 years futureward of the events of venus in book 1, but the humans on Reality TV are living in an alternate past.

The failed moon colony of Book 2 (briefly reference, never seen) is the same as the moon base in this book. The Martian colony is a secret effort of an unknown superuser (maybe the AS imprisoned on the moon). The solar platforms are (similarly) efforts of other AS trying to reproduce the experiments of Io on a larger scale but fail after going mad from being too distant from the surface.

The key thesis is that two people can have the same present with different pasts so long as there are no communicated contradictions. The past is as forked as the future, since everyone comes from different pasts.
