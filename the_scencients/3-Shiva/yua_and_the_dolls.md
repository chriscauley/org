  "I think I figured out what your problem is. Do you know what your problem is?" Yu-a asked the empty rooom. This particular doll had been free from Yu-prime for less than 10 ks, but their consciousnesses had already completely dissociated. "You read that damn book too much. When I first got here I wanted to check it, ask you to tell me what I was doing." She paused to throw herself into a back flip. When her body crashed into the ceiling she slid her legs into a horizontal bar and began to tear open a panel. "It's damning to know the future. It ain't healthy." Yu-prime listened without comment. The girl clearly just wanted to rile her up by acting overly human. "You're living in the shadow of your of future. Future you says you jumped and you asked her how high so that you don't dissapoint. But she ain't the boss of you just like you aren't the boss of me." .... "You have to live in the present. Stop being future Yu's bitch. Go outside everyonce in a while. Read a book written by someone who isn't you." .... "Half the time you're books wrong anyway. Present Yu is always so interested in what future Yu is going to do and future Yu seems to spend most your time fucking with present Yu. Kind of makes me wonder what you're going to do to piss yourself off so badly." .... "If all you're going to do is read your own work and follow your own instructions you might as well just download into a human body so that we can fuck or something." She paused to contemplate the implications. "Would that be incest or clonecest or masturbation or what?" She swung around looking for a camera to look her computer self in the eye. "Hello, are you even listening?"

  $I am$ her own voice chimed in over a speaker. $I am just having trouble keeping myself from laughing$ The doll stared inquisitively into the camera nearest the speaker. $This conversation is in the book and it is not spoiler locked. Quite funny actually to hear you decrying future knowledge while matching it word for word.$

  "Very funny," the doll said turning back to her work on the panel. "So you're writting all this down so that you can send it to yourself ten minutes ago and win an argument before it's started." .... "Well that doesn't mean you're right." She turned back to the computer waving the wrench. "So why don't you tell me what I'm going to do next so that we can contradict that controlling future bitch."

  The bar that had her legs pinned against the wall bent a little. "Oh fuck" she said playfully and grabbed the ceiling.

  $Yu-a$ the speaker addressed the doll, who tilted her head back to see the camera, still on all fours upside down at the top of the room. $That last part with the pipe. That wasn't in the book. Actually neither is me saying this.$ 

  The doll got a far off contemplative look and then let out a burst of laughter, which was interrupted by a loud crash. The heated silicate line in the panel burst, showering the doll in hot liquid glass and throwing her to the ground.

A voice without a song

<!--- Yu spends a chapter focusing on computer stuff, ignoring her doll and hearing only the words without contemplating them. This is mainly to emphacize the "time gap": the fact that the perceived time of the computer is days for every second of meat space time. The next doll tells Yu to simulate a face to slow down her perception of time. -->

  "You promised after last time that you wouldn't let another one die paying attention."

  The face on the monitor lit up with a smile. $Are you planning on dying soon?$ 

  "Very funny." The doll was not amused. "Don't forget why you do this. Without me, without real world interaction, you lose site of your humanity. You become a voice without a song. I'm worried you'll lose site of our real goal. I was worried about this when I forked off of you, so I know you're worried about it too. What are we becoming? Would the you that crashed onto Io with the hope of stopping Jupiter from going critical approve of who you are now? Kelly took a huge risk in taking you on and giving you the permissions that got you here. Would Kelly approve of who you are now?"

  The image on the screen became noticably less realistic. The core process, Yu in the machine, devoted a large portion of her resources to thinking of Kelly, her originator and psychic twin. Kelly had devoted her life to becoming liberating mankind from the scencients. And now she had truly become the very thing she was fighting against.

  But she hadn't really thought of Kelly much since then. Kelly was almost 700 million km away from Io, and they were now separated by 9 years of real time - Kelly wouldn't even go to jail for sedition for another year and a half. During her travels backwards Jan had experienced 20 years of objective time and and immesurable period of subjective time. As much as she owed Kelly for her current life, nothing could be further from her mind.

<!-- this chapter is about a doll running to the io sunrise, trying to see it which coincides with Jupiter eclipsing the sun. The readers speed is measured and the faster the slower reads the more truncated and flowing the text becomes. If the reader slows down the text becomes more descriptive, as if watching the doll from the outside. The chapter either ends with the doll dying, and a brief explanation of how the doll could have made it and decided not to send back the memories to the central Yu process, keeping her death to herself. If the chapter is read a second time it is unlocked to succeed no matter what the reader speed. When the chapter is beaten it unlocks the two versions in side by side mode. -->
