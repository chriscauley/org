  A chorus of tenors  opened with a long high note, which quickly dropped a measure or two before bounding up even higher and higher over. Then they held it, their tones separating and differentiating into harmonies. "To resemble the gates of heaven opening," as Jan had put it in her description to the composer. It exceeded even her own wild imagination. And then, as the female pop star started in, the chorus fell back, singing "bah" in a their respective notes at the end of every measure to set the tempo of the song. The pop star sung of a chance encounter with a man at a bar and the night that followed after. But unlike most songs sponsored by the cyberocracy, this said nothing about wanting to photograph the act and spread it accross the nets. As the first drummer started accompanying the tennors, the pop star sang the line "I've got something just for you", before leading into the songs refrain.

  The message was simple and obvious: go offline, do something offline. Jan would have prefered a bit more subtlety for the mountain of money she had to pay to buy the pop star. However she was pleased with the result as she watched the attendance of her event already slowly declining by three people. Not declining, but the attendence of the audience was slowly being "unlogged" as a measurable number of the members fell steadily. Humans, or "users", as the scenscients non-affectionately called them - Humans off line had little access to their own world. They would even be unable to go to the toilet without logging back on to get the computer to notice them and open the door. Even still as users their every action was still watched, but their action was restricted to the world.

  "Maybe she's a little too good," Jan heard herself think through the cacaphony of drums, tones, and her own growing urge to log off. Maybe the pop star was getting to her too. Or maybe it was just the acid. Jan had become quit addicted to the combination of being logged off while under the infulence of whatever hallucinagenic coctail she could get her hands on. It was the surest way to induce a state of pure freedom: medically offline. While under this state she had access to any computer that she could compel to listen to her physical voice or blue tooth screaming, but said computer would immediately forget the interaction and erase the paper trail afterwards. If any computer recorded even the smallest detail of her while offline, the punishment was to have that detail and any memory recalled since recording the detail violently scrubed from the computers brain. It was not pleasant, but it ensured that even the most free-thinking scenscient wouldn't dare fuck with Jan while she was offline. Thought-crime was something something of distopian nightmares, but thought-law was fucking awesome.

  Her thoughts snapped back to the concert. A dizy wave hit her and she was suddenly aware that she had been awkwardly standing on stage for a few hours, despite her internal clock telling her the song was only 45 seconds in. But she wasn't standing. The acid may took her brain to thoughts of politics, but the XSXC had her body dancing. She spun on, and on, the dark pressure of the drums balanced by the rainbow force of the crowd screeming and dancing. She spun in the symphony of psychedelia, a frail leaf caught between two winds, until the white light of the singer over took her and threw her into the crowd. As she landed on top of the frothing pile of humanity she too took the advice of the singer, her own advice, by proxy. The singer screamed "go offline!" and Jan logged off.

<!-- she gains her offline memories, which she doesn't even notice at first, and then sneaks out of the crowd to meet varthas who is waiting with antidotes to her drugs. She plots and plans and then waakes up the next morning online and unaware of the night before. When she checks the stats she is able to determine that only a handful of people actually logged off in spite of the fact that the night before she only saw dozens logging off the night before. She blames this on the drug, but in book 3 we find out that they were being shuffled to mercury and deleted from the internet and the world. -->
