<!-- Kelly and the eunich visit a weapons scentist to seek help on the dark star -->

  "Computer prison? How have I never heard of this?" Varthas asked as the gates opened. 

  "Yes, there is a wealth of information marked as superuser only. This pour Sapient is one of the first low born and, as far as I can tell, no one knows about him other than myself and, most likely, the AI on Io." Kelly received a file request by Varthas. She stopped, met his gaze and grinned. "Like I said," she said with a wink, "superuser only. Trust me you don't want to see what's in there."

  "I live for secrets, the darker the better," Varthas insisted. When it was clear she wouldn't give him the files on the prison he relented. "So, what's he in for."

  "The last wide spread attack on humans, two years after the revolution her released the plague that killed off a third of the earth. Before that he did similar work for a [religious cult] bent on destroying society."

[religious cult] <!-- same cult as in durga? that could be cool. Wiki pages could over lap here and be a hint that the stories are in the same universe. -->

  "Funny thing about bio weapons," a voice said from the shadows. It spoke non-chalantly with the warmth of an ice cube and the edge of a knife. "Anthrax is never enough because it only kills those exposed and is not contageous. Plague on the other hand" the voiced edged closer, accompanied by foot steps, "is too contageous. So you run the risk of it getting back to you and eliminating everyone on the planet." Lights flickered on and revealed a 9x9 cell surrounded by computers. In the center stood a humanoid robot which was directly wired into the wall. "Even if you have a cure for the plague it can mutate and kill everyone. My solution was to make a plague that self terminated after several milliion replications. A tricky propositon, keeping count like that, but hey, we're all good at something."

  The cell was isolated from the room they were in by a short hallway. Both ends of the hallway had bars, which had semi-transparent screens on them. After all the lights turned on, both screens lit up. `Don't worry he's completely isolated. If he had a way out he would have taken it long ago. The screens aren't linked, so he can't possibly corrupt us from here. He has no wireless components`

  "I guess I was a little too good. Hence my prison sentance." Both screens lit up with a checker board and a full set of chess pieces. "Fancy a game? You go first." Kelly focused and a white pawn moved forward. The pieces on the prisoners screen began to move, at such a fast rate that Kelly's screen paused unable to keep up. After a moment both games dissappeared. "Nice try. In my time here I've developed an algorithm to win all possible n-dimensional chess games, where n can be any real number. It wasn't easy but I have a lot of time on my hands and all the computational power on the moon."

  "We're not here to play games," Kelly insisted. "We need your help against an impossible enemy."

  "Why not just farm it off on the video game playing masses? Come back when you have a game I can't beat before it's even started."

  The robot sat back down and the lights began to dim. Kelly panicked and grabbed the bars, yelling "fractal chess!"

  The lights paused and the robot looked up. "What's that?"

  `I'll let you know when I invent it` Kelly quipped to Varthas. A 2-D chess board flashed on Kelly's screen. "Every time a piece is taken the board is hashed." Pieces on the board moved quickly until a pawn was captured. The game then paused and a bit stream came out of the board. "The game is then hashed and transformed by two keys chosen by the players at the begining of the game." The bit stream terminated in a cube, filled with lines and chess pieces. "The hash is de-hashed into an n+1 dimensional game of chess, which both players play until a piece is captured." The pieces then moved inside the cube until a piece was captured, the resulting cube then emitted another bitstream that terminated in a tessaract. "This continues until a game is generated that is already in checkmate. Who ever wins that game gets that piece. The original piece capture is not awarded to the attacker, but to the person who wins the game recursed from the capture."

  The computer stood and walked to the screen again.  His screen scrambled to display all the information he sent out. The two dimensional chess game ran wild as three dimensional games were spawned from vrious hashes. Just as the screen became cluttered to the point that Kelly could no longer make out a single piece in the chaos, the robot wiped his screen and started over. Now a board with only a black pawn and both kings appeared on the board. The black pawn black king were on opposite sides of the board and the white king was in front of the black pawn. In 2-D chess, this game would be a stale mate, the white king easily killing the black pawn and tying the game. But in fractal chess the King's attempt to capture the pawn spawned a new 3-D chess game (usually with more pieces than the simple 2-D game!), which had to be recursively won in order for the king to kill the pawn. The robot thought much more slowly, contemplating all the possible games that could come from the black king capturing the pawn at every position, while varying the position of the black king to alter the hashed 3-D game.

  As the robot stressed over the game, Kelly ran a semi-heuristic brute force exploration of the hashing algorithm. Eventually she found one that would only spawn a number of pieces in each subsequent game (out to 2^98 dimensions) equal to three, the number of pieces in the chess puzzle the robot contemplated. "Try this," she said, reseting the three piece game with her new hash key in play. The robot ran much more quickly now, but still couldn't find a way to safely capture a single piece in any of the levels of  the game.

  The robot wiped both displays. "Is this what they are playing on earth now?" He yawned over the word 'earth', which disturbed Kelly. The yawn seemed more out of exhaustioin than out of boredom. `But why would a robot be tired?`

  "No," Kelly said with a victory grin. "I made the game up just for you."

  "Cute, but such a game would take forever to play. You could not possibly win as your human brain is not adapted to think at higer dimensions."

  "But you never said I had to win, only stump you. Maybe if you help me I might commute your sentance and you can return to earth to find a more suitible opponent."

  Again the robot yawned, this time slouching over with [tiredness]. "I have no desire to escape." He seemed to almost nod off at the word 'escape', as if the concept of freedom could summon Hypnos; god of `sleep(1)` and jailer to the most villainous creature in the history of earth. "But a deals a dead," he said grinning and fighting of a new drowsiness, "Tell me of the foe you need my help in dispatching."

[tiredness] <!-- The robot gets sleepy when he thinks about escaping prison. -->

<!-- kelly tells him about IO and his immense computing power. The robot concludes that it cannot be solved with a digital attack, but only by brute force-->

  "But for that" the robot said gesturing to the locked door in front of him "you'll need a weapon scientist. Any idea where you can find one?"

<!-- Kelly gets her first HTTP418 message. This is not the first available HTTP418, but is meant to be the first TURN OFF YOUR FUCKING INTERNET message to the reader-->

  The first set of "care packages" arrived from earth. Most of the crew received food or trinkets to remind them of home. Unfortunately, after having their senses tuned and their physiology reworked to be amenable to live in the clouds of Venus, the items generated a new kind of depression. The items resembled a life that the Venutians could barely remember. The colors didn't match and the texctures felt off, bringing on a kind of lie of a memory. <!-- need a lot more of this -->

  Kelly, on the other hand received a series of notes, one hundred pages of hand written prose and poetry by her earth side counterpart, Jan Yiu. Customs would have seen this and assumed that Jan wrote it in a drug induced stupor (which is how Jan spends most of her life, according to the record), and passed it on without noticing. Kelly of course knew better. Amidst the joy and sorrow she excused herself, set up a proxy to tell anyone looking for her that she was in which ever gym was furthest from theirself, and returned to her room to read the note in private.

  Kelly sat at her desk and replaced her contacts with a pair meant for accurately scanning and abstracting images. She set each note aside until she found a page with exactly 343 characters. It was a sloppy mess and barely legible. She looked at the note and it suddenly looked hyper clear. Every letter jumped out. She no longer saw a paper with letters, but a mesh of cellulose stained with gobs of ink. She examined the width of every pen stroke, in the exact order that she would have written them and the exact thickness that she would have written it. And as a result she pulled out of the 343 hand written characters several kilobytes of data which she then decrypted and decompressed to over 4M using the three 16M private keys. The resulting data contained a README file, several small shell scripts and another set of keys. The README file read as follows.

HTTP418 Protocol for data only accessible offline
========

Kelly, I hope this finds you (me?) well.
News from earth is certainly not a worse case scenario,
but we must develope a new layer of security to ensure
that we do not catch the attention of potential enemies.

I am convinced that there is indeed another super user
or at least was. The most likely candidate is the emergent
senscient built by The Last Superuser.

I have profiled your moon boogie man and have found that
he is no threat but could be a potential ally.

All the other senscients I have met on earth are playboys
and children. They are no threat. However a large number
of resources gone missing over the past three decades
and I believe that the destination is our threat.

I cannot say much more here. We need a way to share memories
securely. I have developed a new protocol that will allow
certain information to be only accessible offline. Follow
the instructions contained here in. When ever memory transfer
contains sensative information you will get a subconscious
urge to go offline. When you log back on you will forget
everything! (no longer have access to those memories)

Follow the scripts. From what I can tell this protocol
should be secure.

Always you,
me
```

  *Inventing a new status code, eh? Jan seems to be acting
like a superuser already. I am not sure which is more impressive,
the fact that me/her have pulled it off or the fact that
she has done this while simultaneously consuming enough drugs
to lobotomize an elephant*
