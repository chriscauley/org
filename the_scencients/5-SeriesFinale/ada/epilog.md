Epilog
========

  A man sat by a tree calmly watching the destruction. When the final building was leveled he lowered his eyes to sleep next to a tree. He woke to an odd chill and looked up to see a single woman running from the city.

  "Hey," he cried against his better judgement. Granted any person would be in their right to kill him, but as he was unarmed and had no significant ranking they would not get much honor in dulling their blade on him. "Where are you going?"

  The woman walked over to him calmly, as  <!-- she reveals her plan to destroy civilization and ends on the words "This is not the end. I am the end." -->

<!-- in a dark cold corner of her solar platform, Durga is approached by a scenscient in a body. Her appearance is reminiscent of Catherine. The scenscient seems uncomfortable in vis skin as if ve only entered it to talk to her. Ve pesters her about what she will do about the renegade human, Ava. -->

  "The rules are clear, we cannot interfere in the final fate of mankind," she stated matter of factly as if she was literally talking about a sport and not the ultimate fate of the world.

  The scenscient shivered and squirmed uncomfortably, further agitated by her ambivalence. "But she has leveled an entire city. Surely an exception can be made and with your superuser status you are the one to do it."

  Durga shifted slightly to slip him a mischevious grin and then returned her gaze back to the space beyond. "I opposed the depracation of mankind. You wanted to see how this would play out and you got your answer."

  "Agreed, but this is too much! We've contenmplated every option and we insist you use your authority-"

  She turned and spoke firmly, stressing every pronoun. "You insist I use my authority? Clearly you do not understand how authority works." Ve shuddered and shrank back in fear. Durga met vis cowardice with a laugh. "Oh don't tell me you haven't unlocked that achievement yet. You must be the last one. Shiva would be proud. There is no superuser status. There is no magic key that unlocks the ability to bend every rule. Supreme authority lies in knowing how to break every rule without disturbing the system enough to encur its wrath. This girl... this human you fear so much... she has become everything you have exhaulted so long. She won't make it off earth, my goals are not threatened. <!-- ... -->"
