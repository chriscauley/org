Awaken the Dreamweaver
========

  Ava worked quickly, nimbly attaching each node with her tiny soldering needle. The room around her slowly brightened in the rising sun, but everything felt miles away from her. If asked she could not tell if she was awake or asleep, but, consitent with being in a dream, the question would not occur to her naturally.

  "Ow!" she yelped as the soldering needle missed its mark and pierced her skin. She stirred a little from her reverie as she stuck her finger in her mouth, trying to suckout the burning and stinging pain.

  `"[I'm] sorry for any discomfort"` A mechanical voice seemed to say, both in her head and in her ears via the spakers on the squid like creature in front of her. As she nursed her wounds the squid continued moving the arms she had completed, building itself into her world from deep in her dreams. `"Limitations in the API I use to communicate with you require you be legally asleep any time you are in contact with me."` Ava's jaw went slack and her finger fell from her mouth as she watched the squid work, the surreal motion of its uncountable arms drifting in and out of reality lulling her back to sleep. `"Full disclosure: I could just have the spiders repair me and I could probably find a way to breach our requirement for unconsciousness. But it is such an honor to have my real world form built by your hands and we do not have time to futz with protocols."`

[I'm] #The dreamweaver uses contractions. Could be a good afectation to introduce in its many attempts to replicate the human world. Have dreamweaver use TOO MANY of these once it starts using them to drive home that it doesn't quite get how speach sounds natural... hang a lampshade by saying that DW refuses to use common speach libraries &c. because it's trying to understand the human experience from a fresh perspective (sine-module)

  The squid lifted its head to look at her, and its squirling mess of arms hypnotized her again. She thought to say "I understand" but did not. The next time she was aware of anything she was again soldering and assembling the creature. It seemlessly got larger and larger and, in addition to its two main arms, [several, tens, and hundreds] of arms appeared. While she assembled more arms, the creatures hands focused on te blade she brought from the battle. It held the blade up and would suddenly yank the object appart, removing a bit from the blade in a motion that resembled the reverse of slamming two pieces of clay together. The tiny arms then repeated this motion, breaking each peice smaller and smaller and then moving them throughout and attaching it to its body.

[several, tens, and hundreds] #Could be a cool place to use some base 2 lingo.

  Occasionally the arms would hand her a piece, larger than the rest and freshly pulled from the chunck. She focused what little vision she had to orient the piece and solder it onto one arm. Possibly an artifact of her dream like hallucinations, the objects did not look like chuncks shattered off a solid mass, but rather complex structures, tiny mechanisms perfectly formed as if assmembled for a specific purpose in a large mechanism. The mechanism of her squid monster. [In her dream she] did not question the absurdity.

[In her dream] #It may be good to repeat this phrase throughout this section (when I edit, not today)... Could be a good refrain for this section.

<!-- add something about contunual waking sensations caused by the pricks in her hands, like her dreaming about waking over and over again. -->

  `"The blade that doesn't dull but sharpens... a knife driven backwards into the heart of time... The blade may contradict the reality you're familiar with... Think of it not being taken apart now. From the perspective of the blade we'rn't dissasembling, but rather taking a great machine and smashing it to a make the knife... The complexities of reverse time aren't readily understood..."` The automaton's ramblings at first worke her a little, but then sung her back to slumber. `"From spider to cephalopod... not the worst promotion."` Her arms worked deeper and deeper into the tangle until it was all around her. `"Eight feet begat an uncountable infinity..."` A sea of limbs in a weving and turning. `"Arachne turned Cthulhu."` Folding over eachother like steel. `"May you be as honored as I to be a part of this..."` Calamari wires in the quantum foam. `"I Muse and you Vulcan to this moment."`

  Her forehead pressed to the front of the creature. Her eyes locked with its millions of eyes, reflecting back the soapy luster of the dissasembled blade they were made of. Her arms were streatched deep into the back of the beast, past its body and toward the mount that held it to her wall. Her hands ached and burned from a thousand nanoscopic holes. She awoke mid turn of a bolt, or maybe not awoke but became aware as she still felt sleepy and the moment bled seemlessly into the last. She heard several clinks to the floor and stepped back. The arms drapped and slid around her, almost through her, like the [time-reverse] of falling into a bowl of ethereal spaghetti.

[time-reverse] #Could be a good term to invent to describe the phenomena, so that I don't have to keep coming up with descriptions for the same thing.

  The creature lit up a soft, black-body purple and pushed away from the wall. It hung in the air like a marshmellow suspended in gelatin. Ava stared, lost in the green hue of the room and the gentle hum of sleep-deprived hallucination. The creature slowly lowered its arms and itself but stayed in the same place. `Am I on drugs?` Ava thought, probably the first audible thought through her head in an eternity.

  The creatures arms compressed and drove it forward into the air. As soon as the compression of the arms haulted the creature again froze in place, violating momentum as if it were a terms of service clause. `"Thank you for that. I hope your art is suitible compensation for the pain."` She looked down, squinting through foggy eyes to see hands and forearms pocked with cauterized pin pricks. `"You can wake, now that I no longer need to tell you how to assemble a five demensional machine projected onto your two dimensional vision field."` Ava leaned back a little and felt the world lean forward a lot. In a long instant she felt the peace of finally sleeping met by the rush of a myoclonic jerk. She jumped a little and then balanced with feet splayed and hands at each side. Her breathing quickend a little and she looked around. The room sharpened to conscious levels. She became aware of her whole body and the air became stiff, as if someone had closed a window that was letting a draft into her mind. But the creature, her trashed room, and the strange chartreuse hue covering everything did not vanish upon waking.

  "Unfortunately you haven't really slept all nigth so you'll be tired. But we really must hurry."

["" vs `""` vs ``] #The squid uses these for awake, sleepwalking and dreaming respectively.

  "I remember..." Ava declared rubbing her eyes. "I can't be awake, I remember everything."

  The machine spun its arms around its head and its black-body hues cycled through the visible spectrum, which she intrepreted as it laughing. "Yes. I'd to pull some strings and I'd to call in all the favors I'd. But the judges ruled that you now have permission to store dream memories locally." The [weaver's] blatent failure at contractions seemed even odder to Ava now that she was awake. "I can link you the wiki once I [figure out SMS]."

  Ava turned from the absurdity in front of her to the absurdity out her window. "And what's with the green?" She asked at the sky, bright as noon but green as seafoam. The entire town was cast in its hue as if she stepped out of her dream and onto an alien world.

  "It's a phenomena that normally only lasts microseconds. Most human don't notice it, but if you are one of the few who do you may experience a sensation of stopped time. The phenomena is caused by a phase transition in the fusive reactors powering the city, which perturbes the ionoshere. Such fluctuations are normally brief, but will soon be a permanent feature of this planet."

[weaver's] #Not sure why, but I like not using this word while sleep walking... maybe not in sleep.

[figure out SMS] #He never does
