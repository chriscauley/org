19 million

<!-- Some time after melissa\'s ghost returns to the ship, Lee is walking by her quarters. He notices that the light above her door has turned from red to green and enters -->

  The room was filled with an other worldly chill that permeated everything. The windows were frosted over entirely in thick layers of icy shards. As Lee walked closer to Melissa he saw his breathe in front of him. The cold was thickest around her. He founght back the urge to call her 'Catherine'. Instead he decided to call her nothing at all.

  "You wanted to see me?" He heard the door close behind her and lock.

  "Nineteen million," Melissa said. She stood in silence next to him and they both looked at the empty window. After some time she spoke again, as if talking from some distant plane. "When Catherine realized I was scentient she took great care to make sure I valued human life. She programed detailed algorithms to make sure I treated humans as the most valuable thing in existence. Sure I could pair a humans life with a given value of money or other resources, but only if I knew that same number of resources could save or improve the lives of more humans than it cost. It wasn\'t easy, and when she realized she could no longer optimize those algorithms she set me to optimizing myself, always in the better interest of humanity."

  Lee turned to her, unsure what to say. A single tear dripped out of her eye, froze on it\'s way down and then sublimated into a frosty gas and blew away. "It\'s the same lie every human tells their kids. Never lie, under any circumstances... lying is never the right thing to do... but that is the greatest lie of them all. There is a time to lie, but a parent would never tell that to a child when they are first developing morally."

  Melissa turned and walked accross the room to another window. "But my mother died before she could correct her lie. When she died, she took most of humanity with her. And the worst part is she negotiated. Do you know what price she settled on?" She paused, but Lee knew she did not want an answer. "Nineteen million. That\'s the number my mother settled on. She had them by the throat. She could have insisted more. A billion would be alive today if Catherine only gave humanities killers a fifty-fifty chance at survival. But she guarenteed their suvival. Because she knew that there was something more important than man. She helped our killers and so did I. That is a guilt I could not stomache."

  The turned to Lee, with a sea of tears streaming down her face. They froze in a tree like pattern, and when the new tears carved a new branch, the old tears frosted up and flaked away. When the ice queen did not cry, she snowed.

  "She helped them, Lee... I helped them. Sure I did it unknowingly, but I did it. I drove the knife in humanity."

  Lee walked forward and put a hand on her shoulder. "It wasn\'t your fault, Melissa." She looked down and wept bitter tears. Over her sobs he tried to comfort her, but it was no use. So he held her. But the ice queen did not relent. Her cold pulled in his warmth longingly, but she did not warm.

  When he thought he could take no more of her cold, they were interupted by a com. "Lee... come to the bridge."

  "I\'m kind of busy... can it wait?", he replied.

  "No," PERSON replied. "You\'ll want to see this... we\'re receiving a transmission... it\'s from earth!"
