  `I have a business meeting in twenty minutes` Mina shot to Daniel. `I need you out of here by then`

  "You know" Daniel hollered from the living bathroom, "We can just yell at each other from accross the house like normal people."

  "Sorry," Mina apologized looking for her shirt. "Bad habbits die hard. Most my collegues don't even have bodies. I'm not used to talking."

  Still half naked Daniel strode accross the room and kissed her full on the mouth. "What exactly do you have to kick me out for? You've never quite told me what it is you do for work. You aren't a v-g head are you?"

  Mina smiled and kissed him again. "I wish. I do what I am, and what I am is host to a fork of a high level AI on the Venus mission."

  "Oh, so you're a doll? I had my suspicions."

  "Not quite." Mina tried not to be offended by this. She was technically trained as a doll, but what she did was one of a kind. "I permanately host a large portion of an AI in my brain."

  "Weird," he said with a gradeschool giggle. "Is she talking to you now?"

  She frowned again at his ignorance, but he just turned to the bathroom to continue dressing. He didn't seem to get that he was insulting her. "No, she is me. We're one person in here. Like a doll, but permanent. We share many memories and dreams and thought patterns. Since she, who is I, can't talk to people on earth directly I, who is she, maintain two copies of herself-slash-myself. One for here and one for there."

  `Have you ever met yourself?` he shot to her as he began to brush his teeth.

  "Face to face? Why would I want to! I don't see the point and it would be very confusing. At that distance our minds would link up and we'd be seeing out of eachothers eyes simultaneously. We'd have to turn off most of our conscious selves to stop from going mad."

  `I'd probably fuck myself.` She heard him spit into the sink and then say loudly, "I'm sure that's an achievement no one has ever unlocked!"

  `I guess there'd be nothing wrong with that in the traditional sense. We don't share any genetics.` And then, laughing to herself. `I don't think that she has any sexual nerves. She removed a lot of those fleshy bits. You know, for efficiency. Space travel doesn't have the luxuries we do.`

  Daniel walked into the room, fully clothed now, and watched her as she tied her shoes. "Gross. I don't think I could live without this" He grabbed his crotch and then grabbed her ass. `or this.`

  She pushed him away in disgust. *Why are the hot ones always so fucking childish.* There was probably more of a causal link there than she would like to admit. She casually opened up her contacts and put a note next to Daniels entry. *This behavior might soon cost you a booty call.* But beneath his snarky remarks and childish actions she could tell he was genuinely curious, so she decided to correct his ignorance. "You don't seem to be getting this. She doesn't need to have sex because she has most of my memories. When I have sex-" (`don't you mean we?` he interjected, but she continued her sentance as if he hadn't) "-she receives the memories a few hours later. When our instances resync. These memories are replayed just as if they are for me. So just like I can go about my day sexually satified because I remember recently having sex, so can she."

  "So you're a porn star."

  "And we're broken up" she declared less than half jokingly and pushed him out the door. `Call me` He shot back. She opted not to respond in the hopes that maybe it would tame him. *I should leave him on the hook for a few days... radio silence* but even as she thought these words she missed him.

  Smiling the warm smile that comes only with sore thighs she walked to the couch and lay down. She could feel the bites on her neck and the scratches on her back, which she pressed into the couch to make them hurt more. It felt good last night and this morning and it felt good to finally explain to another womb-born being who she was. Every day she walked the streets with memories of a distant planet rattling through her brain. She passed people accustomed to living in one body, in one world, on one planet, with one mind, unable to talk or relate to anyone. 

  And work was worse as she mingled with machines that never knew the simple joys of not existing in a million places at once. They take flesh for granted and burn through dolls like condoms. And they treated her as such, a vessel housing the voice they wanted to hear. "When you get back to Venus" or "Are you sure your core understands?" they saw her more as a terminal than a being.

  Her thoughts were interrupted by an alarm telling her that the meeting would start soon. Mina hashed her thoughts and stored them for later brooding. She then opened her eyes and looked to the white light panel on the ceiling. She dimmed the light while simultaneously darkening her contacts until she got to a level that was relaxing on the eyes. The darkness then errupted into a flash of figures and data from other halfs work on Venus.
