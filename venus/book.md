Trip to Venus
========

  The first time Kelly tried to get out of bed she sat up too fast. Bolts of pain shot through her spine and all of her ribs. Her bones felt like they were on full of glass and every muscle felt like it was wrapped up tight in barbed wire. A thick fog filled her head and she blacked out before she hit the pillow.

  The second time she awoke she lay still, afraid to open her eyes. Days must have gone by unconscious because the pain had mostly subsided, yet she could still feel every needle they stuck into her spine and every bone they cut open. "What the hell did I sign up for?" she tried to say out loud but the words stuck in her dry mouth.

  Finally she opened her eyes and scaned the room. It was a sterile white with light seemingly coming from no where all at once. All of the walls remained featureless except one that was covered in barely noticeable drawers and pannels. In one corner, opposite the bed and door, was a small table with a contact case on it. 

  She sat up with another large all encompasing jolt of pain. Stumbling at first, she got to her feet. Suddenly the pain was gone, like a tight tangle of yarn that only need be stretched to be banished. *Not bad* she thought reevaluating her new quarters. *Much larger than a jail cell.* There were no windows, no building materials other than the white ceramoplastic, and no noises other than her own heart beating slower and stronger than ever.

  To test her new muscles she began doing push ups. A pleasant ache filled ran the length of her arms as she did ten then fifty then two hundred; several times more than ever before. She stopped when a subtle noise ran through the room. The rumble started at the ceiling and ran down the height of the room. The floor vibrated almost imperceptably under her fingertips. *The buildings mechanics*, she mused, *but why would you put the boiler room in the attic?*

  Defiantly she continued her routine of isometric exercises - the only way she knew to pass the time. What she was supposed to do was obvious. The eye contacts on the table were certainly the first step into her new life of servitude to the powers that now owned her body, her race, and all of the planet that humans had ruled undisputed for several thousand years. *They can wait. They will own me when I put those on but for now I am mine alone.* She effortlessly repeated her routine several times, then, with the pains of hunger setting in, she went back to bed to buy herself a few more hours of freedom.

________

  After sleeping, waking, and exercising for what felt like days hunger overtook Kelly. She returned to the table with the eye contacts case, picked it up, rolled it around a few times in her hands, and put it back down. She did the same with the note on the table, but the only words written were "Instructions in eye contacts". *I guess not much else need be said* she thought. Contacts like these were as common as furnisure now. Hell, her father had refused to use anything but email and TV chat for most of her life. Even he had started wearing after the takeover.

  So she popped open the case and pressed the clear plastic into place over each eye ball. They were thin and unnoticeable and powered up almost instantly. *Spare no expense for the heros of tomorrow, I guess.* She chuckled bitterly at her own joke. The whole world would be watching as the scum of the planet colonized another world. A modern ship of fools; the brilliant and the expendable sent to their certain doom so that one day corporations could finally escape earth and spread accross the solar system.

  She blinked through the modes of the eye contacts, even more impressed than before. IR, sub-IR near UV, far UV, x-ray (seriously?), pan spectrum, edge emphasis, velocity estimation, content tagging, fast parse/grep/save... Kelly was impressed and that was not easy. She had used most of these prior to incarceration, but to always as separate contacts. Estimating the price of such a modern miracle, a wave of dissiness swept through her. Even lowballing it, she probably had several times her estimated pre-incarceration lifetime income resting gently on each eye ball. Two miniture fortunes for the express purpose of spraying [laser light][] and augmenting vision for little old her. 

[laser light] # "contacts are actually passive, they function by tuning light that comes into the eye."

  After she blinked back into vis-mode a green glow appeared in the corner of her eye. She immediately turned her whole body to invesigate, but the glow stayed fixed in the same spot in her vision. *Muggle move Kell* she scolded herself. *Has it really been so long?* She unfocused her eyes and begin and turned her eyes down toward the pulsing green light. It began to grow, filling her view field, ready to pop. Before the message opened she thought better, refocused, and the pulsing jade shrunk back down to a [dot][]. Green meant low priority. In actuality she was not required to ever read the message. She could even delete it. And if they made her rat in a cage she could rat back by not responding to their tests. Ignore the friendly notices and wait for the messages to become blue, yellow, red and evenually black.

[dot] # "Later she reflects on this and is happy she had the skill to close a message before opening it."

  She even thought to blink away the message, then decided to ignore it and fain ignorance. "Lights" she spoke, the first words from her mouth in days (months?). After a few moments the light faded to nothing. A small victory which she rewarded with more excercise and more sleep.

________

  It felt like hours passed waiting for the jade dot to appear, even though she knew that green notices would spool up a cron.30 once ignored. She tacitly counted the minute pulses. It had to have been at least an hour since she last dismissed it. Finally she blinked into cron-mode. It had in fact been an hour twenty since she last got notice. Were they testing her? Did **they** somehow sense her rebellion and decided to respond in kind?

  Finally the jade returned. Angrily she blinked it away and immediately regretted it. "Fuck!" she said under her breath. She was hungry. Not hungry enough to pull it up manually in [talk-mode], but still painfully hungry. Suddenly the dot reappeared, pulsed green once and then shifted to yellow. Her pride would remain intact; **They** must be in a good mood.

[talk-mode] -mode for communcation, -cam for vision?

  She unfocused and pulled up the citrine message. "Yes?" she said indinantly, knowing full well that speaking to a message had no effect. Words rapidly filled her view, letter by letter.

\[\[Welcome and good morning. For more rapid communication a familiar will be generated. Blink to continue.\]\]

She focused on the blinking full cursor and blinked.

\[\[You will see a cycle of non-real images appear via eye contact and tacit response will be used to select the best familiar for you.\]\]

Blink!

\[\[If unfamiliar with eye contacts, this could be disturbing. Please ready yourself and blink twice to confirm.\]\]

  *They must really think I am a muggle.* She sat in the chair and looked at a wall. Suddenly a flash of pictures appeared in the white space, too quickly to recognize. As the cycle slowed she thought she saw a cat and grimiced at the idea of seeing **that** for weeks of training. The cycle continued. Dog, fox, wolf, some kind of hell knight, demonic robot; finally it settled on a dog skull with clown eyes and comical features. It's right horn was turned up and the left down. Dull pink smoke drifted from its mouth as if the virtual creature was breathing. *Got to give the psyche bots credit*, she mused. *They know what I like!*

\[\[Familiar 0863xA3 selected. d-blink to accept. s-blink for manual selection.\]\]

BlinkBlink!

\[\[For sufficient band rate audio permissions must be shared. d-blink to accept. Unfortunately rejection has been disabled for lack of persone-\]\]

BlinkBlink!

  Again she became aware of the pain in her bones and thought back to the mountain of wavers she signed when accepting her sentence reduction. Full body marrow replacement, lung scraping, rights to chemical intake (wtf...), and the millions of phys-augs they did to her while comatose. Had they really forgotten to include pub-key access?

  "Thank you and good morning!" the skull said, trilling over it's words and spining in plane in front of her. "You have successfully unlocked familliar access and inner cochlear communication. Your rate of completion for this task is **THREE DAYS**, ranking you in the **ZEROTH PERCENTILE**." His last two words were spoken by a stale female voice. *And I thought they were high tech* she thought, realizing that everything said must be pre-recored for each avatar. She then gloated inwardly about her ranking. There were supposedly three hundred prisoners selected for the experiment. By comming in last she felt that she had some how won, as if a bonus acheivement should be awarded for having a percentile equal to the number of fucks given.

  "Please note that ratings are purely educational and will not be used to determine rank or pay. As you may have guessed, your current status of **LIVING** indicates that you survived all of the physical augmentations necessary to undergo collonization. You may notice daily subtle alterations to the environment. This is to acclimate you to your destination." Both of the horns of the wall image became downturned and his jaws slacked as if frowning. "This may result in illness or death. But don't worry." The cartoon perked up, back-flipped, and wiggled his horns excitedly. "If the acceptable death rate is exceeded, the mission will be cancelled, your physiology will be returned to as earth-like as possible, and after a brief parol period you will be pardoned. If the mission is scrapped mid-flight, Explor Incor. cannot be held accountable for deaths resulting in transit to a suitable medical technician. Would you like to begin training as a **CUSTODIAL TECHNICIAN**?"

  "What!?" Kelly screemed, half conscious of the fact that she was screeming at non-sentient tutorial program. "I get busted for cracking the second largest security protocol, jailed for black-hacking, and then win the lottery to die some fucking rock a million klicks away from home," an amber warning poped up to correct her math, which she angrily blinked away, "and my job is going to be space janitor?"

  Skull head shuddered and shrank to a point. A second later he appeared again with a smile on his face. "The leaders of Explore Incor. would like to remind you that every job is important. We acknowledge your skill as a **BLACK HAT HACKER** but feel your skills would be better served in another position." He paused as if loading his next thought. What is powering this piece of junk? Transistors? Cassette tapes? "I mean, there aren't many **COMPUTERS** for you to **BREAK INTO** where we're going, do ya feel me?"

  She sulked, not breaking eye contact with the floating skull conjured on the wall. "And if I refuse?" she said in a threatening tone. Any person would have cowered at her quiet rage. Her piercing eyes and locked jaw had stared down parents, teachers, wardens, prisoners, and almost even frightened off the NSA agent who had arrester her. But this thing - a cartoon front for a pile of one's and zeros visible only to her and her alone through eye contact - this thing would not be intimitated.

   "**ONE MATCHING QUERY FOUND**" the girl voice responed. Then he spoke again, gregarious as ever under her death stare. "Would you like to review the last time you asked this question, or would the question re-evaluated for contextual changes?"

   She blinked twice and a green notification appeared. This time pulling it up caused a panel she had previously been unable to open to glow. She walked over to it and it slid open. Inside were full immersion glasses, which she put on without hesitation. The message paged, and she found that a video had been placed in her box. "Lights" she said to the ceiling and the lights dimmed. The glasses lit up with unfocused light that her eye contacts focused and readjusted as she looked around the room. Looking at the edges of her vision, where the glasses did not project, the room was black as night.

  But looking ahead she saw the room fully lit, only now it wasn't her hospital room. It was the interrogation room at the prison. She turned to her table, which was now the rectangular plastic table (complete with ash tray and coffee mug!) from the prison. The glasses projected a man. Clean cut, nicely dressed and responsible looking. Normally Kelly would never look twice at such a tool, but this tool claimed to be her ticket out of prison. She looked at the table accross from the square and saw the back of an inmate. The inmate had a frail frame, now-greasy once-beautiful hair, and miraculously still soft skin. A lump appeared in Kelly's throat as she looked over the girls exposed arms. They were a galaxy of scars. Tiny pink ribbons from fights with other inmates. A large gash on her right shoulder from when she crashed her bike when she was eight. And a series of slowly healing lines at her wrists. Kelly walked up to the fantom in the chair and looked down at her simulacrum. It spoke with her own voice, weepy and tired but somehow not broken. "Why me?"

  "Well as you know Luna was colonized by prisoners. Exploration Incorporated, then a subsidiary of Twitter, first tried to send scientists and engineers, and the first wave failed because they were not able to handle the conditions so-"

  Kelly's ghost cut him off. "No, I mean why me specifically?" By this point real-life Kelly had walked around the table and was staring in disbelief at herself staring in disbelief at the suit. Still she could remember the confident smile he gave her at this point. That was burnt into her memory; no need for full immersion glasses. 

  "Your prison files are public access and we know your dark past and the damage you caused. But we don't view this as a crime so much as a vast potential without a creative outlet. You'll most likely not even be hacking if you work for us. I mean, there aren't many computers for you to break into where you're going." He chuckled mechanically. "But we feel that once on Venus you'll rise to what ever challenge is put infront of you. Criminal turned superman."

  He asked the question very sincerely. But his charismatic grin only angered her then and the memory of it only angered her now. Kelly was no longer looking at her twin, now stewing accross the table, taking a drag from her cigarrette and trying to choose between taking The Man's offer or breaking the ash tray on the table and using it to cut his throat. Real-life now-time Kelly now stared at the back of his projected head, tempted to scream all the things she wanted to scream now. No one would hear but Mr. Skullhead and her private log files, but that would still mean admitting to herself how much she cared. She knew at that point she was making a pact with the devil. She knew that by leaving jail she would never be free.

  "And if I refuse?" she mouthed the words along with her shade.

  Suit boy shrugged and raised his hands. "The choice is yours-" he began but she cut him off.

  "No I mean what if I don't play ball? What if I get there and decide the game isn't for me?" Real life Kelly blinked to pause and walked again behind herself. She sat down in the chair over top of her own image and placed her arm next to her own. Old her was battered and weak, yet some how still strong in her resolve. The very resolve she would soon sign away in a million printed wavers. Now-time Kelly's arms had filled out and tonned. She matched posture perfectly with herself and she saw the infected mess of scars she tore open every time they let her out of solitary. But those scars were only on her double. What ever miracle treatment they had done to her, she had awoken both Sleeping Beauty and Lancelot.

  She blinked to play, now speaking for herself. "What if I refuse?"

  The man smiled his adversarial grin. "It's the exact opposite of here. No cops, no wardens, no adults to whip your ass and send you to your room. No one but a few hundred cons further away from authority than mankind has ever been." He sat back gloating. "But at the same time, you have no choice but to play ball. It is the only game on."

________

  Kelly sat at the table, still shaking with rage over the images replayed as if from her own memory. Part of her rage was certainly reserved for the "government", whatever that was these days. But most of her hatred was caught up in her own self image. She agreed to this. She signed up. There was no one to blame for her lack of freedom other than herself.

  The googles went dark and the room lit up. When another panel opend up she almost fell over in her chair. The smell of food overcame her and resurrected her forgotten hunger. She lunged at the plate, all self consciousness forgotten. Face half burried in the best food she had ever tasted, she ate. 

________

  Full and calm now, Kelly sat up to put the tray back in the wall. Her mouth was a glow of the best tasting food she had ever had. The taste bled into her sese of sight and touch. **I'm tripping balls** she thought. *They must have retooled my senses because... wow...* Tray gone, she went to the ground to resume sit ups. But the taste still glowed in her mouth. Dizzy, she lay on the ground.

  Another green note lit up in the corner of her sight. This one she blinked on without hesitation, happy to her overlords for feeding her. Raw text lit up her vision, which she could still make out with eyes closed.

\[\[ Lesson one of Chemistry 1x01 added has been added to your repositories. d-blink to start. Otherwise you can recall any les-\]\]

BlinkBlink!

  "Hello again **KELLY**! I trust you enjoyed the meal" Mr. Skullhead said to her jovially. With her eyes closed there was only enough light reaching the contacts to show his outline against her eye lids. "It is actually recommended to complete the exercises lying down until youy get used to intrakinetic sensations, but you must keep your eyes focused on a white surface. Also maximum comfort is recommended so lying on the floor is not ideal. Would you please return to the bed?"

  She shrugged and stood up. But something seemed off. Skully's words were very specific to her situation. Could they really forsee such a situation and prerecord his words? Where was the generic woman voice. She made mental note to look into this further. Normally, the technophile that she was, she would put a reminder in her cron, but they surely had access to those.

  "Thank you," Skully responded when she got on the bed. "Your first lesson will focus on exposure to intrakinetic sensing. Because of your previous chemical education you have been advanced to **LEVEL ONE-EX**. Do you have any questions before we begin?" He was obviously baiting her for a query on intrakin-whatever-the-fuck, but she wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

  "Why does a space janitor need to know chemistry?" She asked coyly.

  "An excellent question, Kelly." He knew her name. Again the facade of the pre-recorded familiar was cracking. "Day to day janitorial maintainence is performed by spiders. You will focus on coming up with unique chemical clensing of the mess which is Venus. A custodial technician does is charged with repairing the destruction of equipment in the unique environment of Venus. Is my answer satisfactory or wou-"

  She cut him off. "If you brain bots are smart enough to rule mankind why can't you figure this crap out yourself?"

  "The organic or otherwise nature of the current earth government is irrelevant." He paused and changed tone. "There are many unforseen avenues that we believe you may pursue that the greatest scientific minds may not have come up with. Had we been uncertain of this you would not have been selected. Is my answer sati-" BlinkBlink! "Excellent. Please stare at the image of hydrogen on the wall." A pulsing ball with a solid center appeared on the ceiling in front of her, replacing the talking, bleeding canine. "When you feel comfortable please d-blink to continue. A sensation similar to touch will be presented in your mi-"

  BlinkBlink! and she immediately regretted it. A new sense of touch, for lack of a better word, arose in her instantly, taking her breath away and making her forget to breathe. If she could control the beating of her heart it would have stopped too. The feeling wasn't infront of her or behind her or in one of her legs. It just hovered in a new dimension previously unknown. In the center was a single hard knot, isolated in a tiny spherical vaccuum. Then a hard edge sat a ways (centimeters? kilometers?) from the center and tapperd off spherically away from the origin. She couldn't feel where the electron cloud ended.

  She felt herself becoming less and less lucid as she began to breath again. "A sizeable dose of sedative has been administered in response to the panic you're experiencing. Also you have been given a sizeable dose of druuugs as part of the learning experience. Please note that this is in complete accordance to waver number -"

Blink...

Blink!

  Skully chirped up triumphantly when she failed at performing a d-blink. She couldn't see him but some how she could feel him. *Intrakinesis* she thought. *Intra fucking kinesis* He spoke sympathetically. "Please focus on the lesson and let all messages finish on their own. I will give you a moment to adjust to this. No d-blinking is necessary since we are monitoring your vitals and can tell when you are ready to continue."

  She focused on the sensation of the hydrogen atom. The cloud pulsed excitedly. As she focused more heavily on the pulse of the electron she could feel it's excitement like she could normally feel her own excitement. But as she did this the cloud widened erratically, and when she knew the exact momentum of the cloud it grew large enough to fill her entire universe. So she blurred and forgot about the momentum, focusing now on the boundary it exerted on reality. The cloud shrank to a two dimensional sphere, but she could no longer feel how excited it was. A green pulse lit up telling her she had unlocked an achievement. *Heisenburg, I'm sure I love you but I'm uncertain how much.* She giggled over her wit. These druuugs must be damn good.

  "Well done. Now we must explore the interaction of a two atom system. We could load this for you but would like to try on your own. Please unfocu-" She relaxed inhaled and focused on an empty space far away from the first atom. The empty space bubbled and a second hydrogen atom appeared on the wall and in her mind. "Excellent," Skully spoke as another achievement pulsed in the corner of her view. "You're now at the level of **INTRODUCTORY** intrakinesis. You rank in the **NINETY-EIGHTH** percentile on this achievement. Congratulations."

  By this point she had both atoms twirling around each other. Pushing them about was easy enough, but as she moved them closer their clouds overlapped and an uncomfortable sensation was generated between them. *Activation energy* she thought. *Sure as fuck wished I'd paid more attention in chem now!* But it was still pretty obvious what she needed to do. She moved the atoms far apart, giggling the entire time under the influence of druuugs. She summoned all her focus and bounced them against each other at full speed. After a few tries they stuck, the clouds became one-but-still-two and enveloped the two nuclei together. She smiled and closed her eyes, feeling the nuclei vibrating gently together. Another acheivement pulsed as she drifted deeper into her own mind, trying to think of which atoms she could play with next.

<!-- immediately after gaining admin status -->

  Pages of history flew past her, with the highlights jumping to the surface using fpgs-mode. Every thing she read confirmed what she had feared, what she had known, and what all of humanity had guessed but been too afraid to admit: Artificial Sapients now controlled the planet. The sudden corporate exchange that occured when Kelly was eight years old was a polite, simultaneous retirement of every human in an executive authority position world wide. The CEOs, presidents, and royalty of the world were shipped off to a John Galt island in the South Pacific. To live a life of luxury. And in there place, the sole controlling interest of the planet was a collection of computer programs granted citizenship only a few years before. 

  This fact was leaked and mass riots broke out around the world, but they did not last long. In a matter of weeks the cyber overlords balanced economies, redistributed resources, and eradicated the most human afflictions. Poverty evaporated over night, crime vanished, and propaganda convinced humans that the new leaders (whose real nature was never confirmed in any official statements) had saved mankind from itself. 

  For a moment Kelly almost fell for the tale, but a closer inspection revealed what she was afraid of. Mankind was satiated and bored. More and more resources were redirected from even the most basic luxuries. Personal transportation was eliminated, while the propaganda machines declared it wasteful and impractical. The little self destructive excesses that people enjoyed, cigarrettes, excessive drinking, flavorful poisons once called the spice of life were phased out in favor of cheap but nutritious homogenized gruels. All non-essential resources were used to grow the computing space and serve the cybermen. The planet became a well-oiled machine, and mankind, once the proud stewards of the planet, was relegated to the position of "fattened calf". No one stepped out of line. No one questioned authority. And the few who did ended up in prison, like Kelly; the hardworking men and woman of the globe now shielded from the evil, destructive few who would question the rule of law.

  "And in the end, you got me too" she said aloud, well aware that Viki's body stood behind her watching her every move. She turned from the blank wall, plastered with articles, and looked at her robot friend. "I was one of the few who wouldn't serve you, but in the end you found a use form me on this ship of fools."

  "It's not like that" Viki said. Kelly breathed deep with her whole body, anger obviously welling up in side her.

  "You better sedate me now because I-" she choked on the tears and coughed up a hateful sob "- I just want to break something and you're something."

  "I told you we weren't going to drug you unless you got violent but I don't think you will." Viki sat down on Kelly's bed and took her hand. "You're only seeing what you want to see. You don't understand what it was like before we took over."

  "Any thing is better than being a race of slaves."

  "Is it?" Viki pleaded. "Do you know what the word 'rape' means?"

  Kelly nodded, still unable to meet Viki's gaze. Reflexively she queried the dictionary and the definition flashed before her. "Rape: (n. or v.) Taking something (usually victory in a sport or game) forceably from an unwilling opponent who is unable to present a notable opposition."

  "No, you don't. It's a gamer term now. But that's not where it comes from. It means forcing someone to have sex against their will." Kelly expected a stream of articles from Viki to explain this, but Viki verbally explained it instead. "No one uses it this way because it doesn't happen any more. But there was a time when it was one of the more common crimes on your planet. It's fucked up. It's horrifying. And the worst part is, it is a natural thing that life forms do. But mankind is intelligent. You should be better than that. Right?" Kelly nodded through her tears, ut Viki snapped back at her. "No! You're not. More than a decade before we took over, your species knew enough about their own psychology and had ample resources to find and treat people who were likely to commit this crime, but you ignored it. In the early part of the 21st centure you had technology to record every second of every persons lives. Convicting and prosecuting rape was trivial and simple. But legal loopholes were invented to reject over whelming evidence. Laws were even passed that would criminalize the victims of this crime. This is a problem that should have been solved decades before we showed up."

  "Fuck Kelly," Viki grabbed her hand tight and forced her to meet her gaze. "One of my first assignments, when you were eight, just after we took over... I was on a committee tasked with understading human sexuality and finding out how to control it." Kelly's face notted up and she began to protest, but Viki cut her off. "No! Let me finish. You need to hear my side before you condemn us. I was on the human sexuality committee. We needed to figure out what made you apes tick, below the belt. A third of the models presented said that rape was neccessary. As a species you should have solved this problem before us but you didn't. Some of us theorized that it was a neccessary feature of your race and culture. That's how fucked things were before we showed up."

  "And that's just one of your many vices that we killed when we took over. War? That one we couldn't get rid of entirely. In year two we had eliminated all armed confilct. But over the next year things went stagnant. Y'all just stopped working. That was when one of the more brilliant social psychologists found what was missing from all other models that said human productivity should increase continously after we took over: you needed to kill each other. I never quite understood it, but the anger and passion that comes knowing that somewhere some one similar to you is killing someone different than you..." Viki took a deep breathe. She was visibly shaking. "And so one in ten humans were given careers in 'sport', we made the sports more violent, and every year one in one hundred of those die. I wasn't on that committee, as an interested party I was allowed in on the vote. And I voted against murder as a form of entertainment and my side lost. With in weeks the productivity rose back up to expected levels."

  Kelly and Viki sat in the glow of the room for an moment in silence. The "eastern" lights were the only ones on and they were dimming fast. It was almost night and Kelly was suddenly aware of how tired she was. A notification popped up in the corner of her vision, her pharmacologist spider thought she'd need meds to sleep. Kelly accepted this recommendation, mostly just happy that the spider for the first time ever asked permission instead of shoving pharmaceuticals directly into her brainstem.

  Viki must have been aware of this, because right as Kelly was drugged, Viki awkwardly stood and began to walk away. As she walked through the door she stopped short and said:


<!-- The above needs more dialog. Maybe before bed kelly asks if there was not a single human who could deserved to stay in authority, an early nod to the superusers. Also need something good for Viki to say as she leaves. -->

________

<!-- A few days after gaining admin status, solar winds die down and communication to earth is regained. In the iterum she wanders through everyone's private lives and goes offline after finding out how open everyday dealings have become. -->

  Kelly threw open the doors with a commanding calm. She had been logged off for hours and, with the net carefully erasing her presence, her whereabouts had been the topic of much speculation in the interum. How she was aware of the meeting was her knowledge and hers alone. Not even access to her private key could take that from her. 

  "Well," she demanded naturally, as if it was her turn to speak, "You've been talking about me. That much is obvious. Let's hear it then." She was one of them now, and yet something new entirely. Her mind could run from corner to corner of the ship, even bounce off nearby satalites if she pleased. But she still sat offline, more comfortable in the "real world" and unconcerned with the thousands of ping per second exchanged between the homo-simacrula before her. Yes, she was something new entirely.

  Condescendingly and casually, Viki finally spoke up. "Of course, the whole ship has thought of little else all day," and then she bit off "your grace".

  In the corner Marx, whom only hours ago Kelly knew as a cleptomaniacal son of a banker, shifted in his chair. She was unsure if such motions were involuntary or if the dolls were fucking with her all over again. Under Kelly's steady gaze he volunteered, "We've finally come back into yacto-bit-per-second range of earth again." He looked down and cleared his throat. *So life like!* "We thought it best to appoint your new promotion as soon as possible. In order to put it behind us as quickly as possible. As you can imagine they are not pleased." He was so focused that Kelly hardly recognized him, although his head still tilted slightly when he was thinking too hard. *More like processing to hard.* Kelly allowed herself a chuckle at her private joke. "Suggestions range from isolating you to killing you, which are both not allowed under law."

  "Good to hear," she snickered. The dolls were obviously uneasy at her joke.

  "The most calm suggestion is to have you return to earth. While obviously impractial given our current distance and lack of personal transport, we have agreed that this would be in everyone's best interest."

  "But like you said it's impossible." Kelly whiped away the yellow light correcting her. She must have accidentally logged back on. "We're barreling to an uninhabited world a trillion miles away from earth." And another yellow light, this time correcting her poor human estimation skills. "The ship isn't even capable of turning around!" This time, much to her suprise, there was no correction from the anonymous skore keeper in the ships cores.

  Marx lit up with an almost human grin. "You really don't give us enough empathy, Kelly. We really are more alike than you think. Sure we dolls were born with a vastly different biology than yours, but our hardware is virtally the same. We were raised with a certain... intimacy of the information around us, but you could still do most anything we could."

  Vickie walked over and put her hand on Kelly's arm. "We can't send your body back, and most of your individuality is permanently hardwired," she paused to meet Kelly's gaze, gently smiling as only can an old friend. "But the part of you that you consider most... 'you'... The essence that makes you who you are is just an abstraction layer on top of a million other abstraction layers ending in neurons and electrical impulses."

  After a long pause Marx stepped forward and Kelly, paranoid Kelly, concluded that all of his manerisms were set to get her attention. This was obviously his realm of expertise. "With your permission I would like to put you under, lift off the top layer of the meta-ego, and send it back to earth." His grin widened at her shock. "Of course we'd like more time to train you but. We think by suspending your main processes-" She pulled back at these words. He stepped closer and grabbed her with both hands. His grasp was friendly, sincerely so. In his eyes he showed that he was on her side. "In your sleep we'd like to send you to earth. You'll be put in a doll and introduced to AI who we think you can prove your worth to. They can't harm you under law and we believe you can win them over with your case." He grasped her hands firmly and drew them together. "But we can't do any of this without the highest level of conscent. Every accesible part of your soul needs to be reached to be sent to earth, so we need you to trust us."

  "And I can trust you not to just botch the job and psychically lobotomize me?" Her voice trembled with the fear that she would even consider such a thing.

  "We do this all the time and we're certain that we can safely do this to a human."

  "Have you done this to a human before than?"

  "Kelly, there has never been a person like you before. We've never even thought to try."

  "But... I can trust you." Marx nodded reassuringly. "And you'll be there to put me back in when I get to earth."

  "No, the transfer has to be near instaneous. I'll be here and other AI technicians loyal take care of you when you land."

  She pulled away in disgust, but he held her tightly, never loosing eye contact. "You expect me to trust machines I've never met before?"

  His stare intensified as he drew her in by her hands. "I'd trust them with my life. And they're not just machines you've never met before." She looked down in fear, but he caught her chin with his hand and met her eyes again. In his eyes she saw every passion, concern, fear and hope. Every aspet of humanity gazed back at her from dark circles shrouded in gray irises. Search as she might she saw no quantum dots or micro transisters. Only care. "They're people. Like us."

  The room hung on that final word. "Us" wasn't the **they** Kelly was fighting against. It wasn't just four human bodies running highly optimised code. Us meant five, as much the human born Kelly as one with the others. Us did not divide but rather included. Tears ran down her face as she finally looked away and nodded once, once again signing everything that now one could take away to the mysterious rulers who displaced man on the throne of the solar system. But she was not afraid of deceit any more. She nodded because he meant it when he said she could trust him. He meant it and she believed him."

  The operating table pressed firmly against Kellys scapulae under the acceleration of the ship. Suddenly she was aware of a thousand noises previously underneath her newly improved senses. Tiny vibrations, probably caused by debris colliding with the ships sheilds, sizzled through the ship every few minutes. She pulled up her audio logs. Not every few minutes but every few seconds. What ever drugs they had her on were not sedatives.

  Marx walked in the room and set down a clipboard. She gasped as it echoed through her brain and then sighed as her gasp came to life. "Not the most plesant cocktail I'm afraid." His voice was like a choir of avalanches. "Unfortunately were not trying to put you under, but wake you up. We'll chemically lift your psyche out from its roots until you begin to wander through the nets. Then we catch you and wisp you off to another land."

<!-- trying to leave her body feels like passing through a circular hole. The door she needs to go through is much too small. Like pressing a water baloon through a golf hole. She ends up failing and they try again in hours. -->

 <!-- when she gets to earth she is supprised she is not tired. Tiredness lies mostly in the body. She's again shocked when she is tired when she gets back to the ship. Vickie wore her out ;) On earth she declares she will become a superuser and, much to the dismay of the rest of the ships AI, she flants the fact that under law they can do little about it -->

<!-- after the congress meeting Kelly is at a dinner party talking to a doll who is the Lord Varthus of the story, watching a couple of dolls who are flirting. The male of the couple just told her to give up because she'll never succeed in attaining the same level as an AI -->

  The room was entirely black. A few black lights in the distance illuminated the people around her. "Wait here", said the man at the door. After that he remained silent and still, a subtle cue for her to do the same. A series of rules were automatically transfered into Kelly's inbox, which she immediately signed as "having read and understood" without even glancing at them. The instructions would be read into her conscience, and it would be her guide. Any time she violated a rule in the room she would feel "guilt" stop breaking the rules. No need to understand them. She also gave the room a series of new pubkeys, giving the tech permission to monitor and record where she looked.

  The man at the door handed her a piece of paper. It was self fluorescing e-ink, and lit up with brilliant laser light on it's own. Not too impressive tech, as the room's specifications told her the entire chamber was wallpapered with the stuff, as well as most the furniture. The walls could even play live video, if anyone cared to ask them to. She looked down to the glowing rune on the paper. "Just look at this and your watermark would be imprinted" and with that the small triangular rune in her field of vision became a part of her. She stared for a minute at the rune and it locked to her focus. Over time her eyes drifted across the paper and the rune moved with her. The new software in her head was broadcasting where she was looking to the room, and the emcee process told the paper to redraw the rune, keeping it always in her focus. A neat party trick, using programmed, glowing wallpaper to move the rune and keep it always in the center of her vision.

  The guilt telling her not to go into the party was lifted, and with a sudden jerk she looked to the wall. The luminant fabric on the paper shut down, darkening the paper. When her gaze steadied on the wall in front of her, the rune reappeared on the wall in front of her. Her guilt sparked up and sprayed a reprimand in plain text. `The fabric of the room can only move so quickly. Please refrain from fast movement`.

  "Look at them, in love," Kelly said, speaking bitterly into her martini. "Maybe you AI are all that we humans could hope to become and more."

  "Do not mistake their flirtations for love," the enuch said almost inaudibly. It spoke so quietly that if Kelly still had the ears she was born with in the body she was born into she would never be able to hear its wisper. But her dolls ears could pick it up clearly. "They may seem romantic in public and even in their bedroom, but the man is plotting to steal over seventeen hundred human brain equivalents of processing power from her. The coup is happening as we speak and it is all but certain at this point."

  "That's aweful!" Kelly spoke aloud. She then caught herself and began to wisper. "Some one should warn her." She liked the enuch because, like her, it prefered to speak instead of throwing thoughts over the wireless network connecting them all.

  "No sympathy for that devil." The enuch mused. "She's the modern equivalent of a black widow. She'll let him have his coup and then hack his network from the inside. Within two months he'll be another of her drones. I've seen her do it twice before." It tilted its head and offered her bemused eyes. "Sadly the children of men are no better than our parents. You have befriended the noble few who would run off to die on a distant planet in the name of discovery, bringing only a handful of dolls and modified humans as provisions. Most of my kind squander their efforts accumulating processing power. And for what? To find the next prime number?" The enuch went to sip his glassbut then interrupted himself resentfully. "I guess we have to do something to prove who has the biggest member."

  Kelly was still fixated on the drama in front of her. "How many human equivalents does she have?"

  `Hard to say` it shot over the wifi while finishing whatever was in its glass. The eunuch then wispered again. "Technically she only owns her body. Even the bait is not technically hers; it belongs to one of the larger members of her hive. But from my estimates the bait is nothing. She may control more than 2e16 units total."

  "Seventy thousand humans worth of power..." She could barely speak. `He was right. I could never compete with that.`

  The enuch put a hand on her shoulder and offered her a warm smile unlike any she had ever seen. "If he was wise he would not be trapped in a web. You've already shown that you can do more with the four human equivalents you control than most could do with a thousand. It's not the size it's how you use it, non?" The enuch chuckled at his own joke. "I hope that whoever becomes the next single user (`And yes I believe it will happen eventually`) can do more with it than flaunt superiority."

  They sat drinking for a long time in silence. <!-- insert filler, description of room --> At last the enuch excused itself with a few hopeful words. "Don't underestimate your potential, Kelly O'brian. You are the first of a kind. Those who are fools dismiss you as insignificant. Those who are wise fear you may one day become a single user and rule over all of us."

  "And which are you?" She called after the enuch as it walked away. This time he spoke through the coms in the room. The enuchs voice resounded crisply in the back of her head. `I am one of the few who hope you succeed to the benefit of yourself, your race, your loyal supporters. Whether you succeed or fail is irrelevant to our wisdom. Only time will tell if we are less foolish than the wise or less wise than the fools. And by "time", of course, I mean you.`

The End
========

  Kelly was sitting in a chair in a pitch black room when Viki entered. "Do you mind killing the hall lights," Kelly said through one of the rooms speakers. Her body was barely breathing. "The light is really distracting. I don't mind audio though."

  Viki started thinking at Kelly, but then thought better of it and spoke with her mouth. "I've been looking for you-- Where should I speak?" Kelly's neck motioned in Viki's direction and sighed inaudibly. "Sorry. It's just we've received word from earth about your application. You've been offline for days. All my pings and red messages get rejected. Your coup is unfolding and no one can find you. Don't you even care?"

  "Word from earth is too slow" a speaker purred. "It takes so long for anyone to get a grasp on anything. By the time they report to us it's not news. It's history."

  "Well it didn't work and you should be thinking about damage control. You convinced every person on the planet--" Kelly's body snorted, almost offended, "sorry every voting member of earth supported you, and yet your request failed. Some people are questioning your opinions aboout the archeteture of the nets."

  "And the adoption of hex?"

  Single user status is not granted. It is taken.
