The Human goes to Washington
========

  An informal polling system known as "exit polls" showed that almost the entire room was against her. "Even if you do agree with the actions of Viki and the rest of the Venus crew, there is no legal avenue available to sanction this. The only option left to us is to scrap Kelly Obrien entirely and send a sapient process to take over her position," the senator concluded. The numbers continued to bow against her in the polls as he finished, "The legal mechanism for this exists, where as there is no law allowing a human, let alone an known criminal, to gain user status. This body simply cannot allow and cannot execute such an order. No ammount of parlor tricks will allow it. So I move to formally execute Kelly Obrien, reclassify her body as a doll, and start the search a sapient capable of taking over her responsibilities as head chemist on the Venus mission." He sat down and the chairman opened his mouth to speak, most likely to cemenet her final condemnation. Almost all the room was against her, all that was left was technicality.

  "That is one way to look at it" a voice chimed in from the back of the room. Kelly quickly shifted her vision from camera to camera, but was unable to get a good look at him. Whereever he sat was one of the rare in Washington not covered with survelance. The record listed him in as a "low born" sapient who, although present at every senate hearing since his "birth" eight years before, had never logged a single vote or even comment on the senate form. Quite a feet, considering that every word spoken in the senate was logged. 

  "Senator Varthas" the chairman responded, trying to hold back a grin. "Are you finally emerging from the shadows to stick up for this girl?"

  "If you'd like to elaborate on your accusations, I'd love to have my first official statement confirm whatever you're accusing me of saying to you 'in the shadows'." What ever he was implying seemed to shut the chairman up. "Now if I may continue, the general picture painted today is that of a human who, through deception, trickery, and unheard of hacking, tricked more than one hundred of the smartest sapienet processes into divulging state secrets and granting her user and admin status. This same human now petitions the senate for superuser status and dominion over all of the Network. But, as with all acts of magic, I believe that the opponents of this miracle are mistaking a series of small tricks for a very large and impossible feat." His words inflammed the body, generating a symphony of spoken whispers and encoded signals sent over the networks. But as far as Kelly's packet sniffers could tell, Varthas remained silent, both audibly and digitally. He stood perfectly still among the chaos, with his statuesque gaze locked on the chairman. 

  Finally the chairman banged his gavel, silencing the room and restricting network communication to emergency requests only. And with that the control of the room centered on a distant desk in the corner. All eyes were on the least watched spot in the city. "But I think the actual tale is much less severe. You see, Kelly died long before the drama started. As the convict slowly discovered state secrets, Viki was forced to continually erase Kelly's memories and apply drugs that would loosen her knowledge. These same drugs and tactics are to suppress the soul and erase the identity of a fresh doll before a sapient enters it. I believe that long term exposure plasticized Kelly's brain. As Viki ran more and more of her own processes on Kelly Obrien to monitor Kelly's potential criminal activity, Kelly became as a doll. Whether or not this was intentional on the part of Viki will never be known. That knowledge died with her on the surface of Venus. The first casualty of its kind."

  "But when the two minds merged in Kelly's brain", he continued, "they became indistinguishable. I believe that splitting Viki and Kelly back into two hosts was unclean, and the two are now hybrid minds, part human and part sapient. So I move to reclassify Kelly Obrien as a low born, a sub process turned sapient, and grant both her and Viki all the rights of a forked sapient."

  The room erupted again. This time the chairman just tried to talk over it. "It's a lovely story, and one worthy of being your first official communication in the governing record." He smiled the daring smile of a man who knows he's won a long standing argument on a technicality. "But as you say, there is no way to prove this since all of Vikis knowledge was lost on Venus and her memories are very unreliable."

  "That is only half true" Varthas said with the same unshaking confidence as before. Even without being able to directly see the man, Kelly could hear his steady gaze in his voice and see his calm in the faces of those looking at him. "You will recall the first half of this hearing, when many here supposed that Kelly was actually a prank by Viki, that the sapient living in the doll before us is actually not Kelly. This would partially explain the parlor tricks the doll has performed: simultaneously viewing information on the network while being medically and legally off line. Yet, hashes taken from Viki and Kelly before and after the accident and of this doll have proven that we are infact speaking to the first human to ever dissociate from her body and enter into a doll."

  By now the room was silent. With her ears, Kelly could have heard a pin drop from accross the room and digitally she could have picked out network noise caused by a falty quartz crystal in one of the light fixtures. She wasn't even watching the room via camera any more. But she could feel the entire room swelling around her, aching to hear what the shadowy man said next. 

  "So how did a simple human, most of her mind left on Venus, living in the body of a drug addled, self mutilated, blind [reject doll] hack our systems and access priviledged information while offline? This trick can easily be explained with a registered set of ident_keys. But the only keys Kelly could have access to belong to Viki and even if Kelly had them, ident_keys are knowledge, not memory. They are useless to anyone other than Viki herself. So, unless a human missing [half her brain] and running on faulty hardware could circumvent our security system, Viki an Kelly must have become similar enough people while sharing a brain to allow Kelly decryption of Viki's knowledge!"

[reject doll] at this point she received a `no offense` message directed to her from Varthas; an impressive feat considering that she was off line.

[half her brain] <!-- What if I mark this and all other rhetorical statements red, like the computer correcting Kelly's early hyperboles? Add semantics to the novel! -->

  The tension in the room sat like a thick fog. She sat in the darkness and silence and breathed it in. It was a strange solitude, somehow completely alone while the most powerful figures in the solar system waited for some sign. Alive with the attention and her pending victory, Kelly stood up and hopped over the podium, landing with seductive grace. Guided only by memory, she walked through the room. She walked up the center aisle to the back. The only noise, her foot steps, she could feel the eight hundred eyes watching her walk blindly. When she got to the back she hopped up over one of the barriers and walked on the final row of tables. She placed her hand on one flabbergasted senator's shoulder and then, on the floor again, ran her fingers through the strangers hair affectionately and blew him a kiss. "Broken doll my ass!" she quipped. The security guards, chairman, and sitting senators were too shocked to stop her as she walked to the door. 

  With her back to the room, she encrypted an annonymous message, signed it and sent it to her doctor. "Surely everyone saw that" she mused. The only noise in the digital vacuum was her passing a note that no one in the room could read. Milliseconds passed before she got a response. When it came, she was no longer medically signed out of the Network, and the protocols of the room automatically put her in the digital forum representing the physical forum around her. She passed one of Viki's ident_keys and was authenticated without question. The first message she received from said forum (which everyone else received simultanously) would crash the fog of silence around her and bring on the budding storm. `[AdminUser:Viki Diaz] has entered the room.` She walked out the door, automatically logging herself out of the senate before anyone could respond. She left the trial confident of her victory, leaving behind a cataclysm of noise and signals.
