<!-- when "Jett" meets the zombie deamon of Venus -->

  "NAME I knew it was you."

  "No, I am not her. Parts of me are... it's so very complicated in here. If a man is a character in a book then I am a book of characters.

I also have a thousand other souls inside me, screaming to be heard. If you want you can make love to the woman you lost, or you can scream murder at the man who took her from you. These moments of your past are frozen inside me, and, in some way, each lives on still. So which would you like me to be?"

<!-- possible story idea...maybe a fairy tale for young time travelers... A young time traveler battles with an older version of himself. When the older time traveler is defeated, the older time traveler is confident that he can win. He is convinced that fate has his victory assured. When the elder loses he curses the fates, saying that they have betrayed him. The younger is raised believing that he can change his fate and imagines (unjustifiably so) that he as resisted fate. Finally, when the aged version battles himself he is confident that he can win, defeating the fates. When he fails he curses the fates -->
