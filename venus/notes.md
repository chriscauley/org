<!-- when "Jett" meets the zombie deamon of Venus -->

  "NAME I knew it was you."

  "No, I am not her. Parts of me are... it's so very complicated in here. If a man is a character in a book then I am a book of characters. If each moment in a persons life is a song and each lifetime a discography than I am an infinite playlist of people. I have her in me... parts of her at least. I also have a thousand other souls inside me, screaming to be heard. If you want you can make love to the woman you lost, or you can scream murder at the man who took her from you. These moments of your past are frozen inside me, and, in some way, each lives on still. So which would you like me to be?"

  "I spent the last decade chasing after that hate and mourning over that love. But I can forget the past. Can I just get to know you?"

  She smiled a complex smile, a strange mixture of bliss and cunning and irony and something else that he had not seen before. "I'd like that," she said and lay her head on his chest. "I think I'd like that very much."
