The Search for the Last Superuser
========

<!-- Kelly wants to free the low techs by bringing them the network, but eventually realizes (through the help of the last superusers father) that low tech isn't a weakness, it is a challenge and challenges bring strength -->

    Jan leaned against a lamp post in despair. Her search seemed hopeless and she couldn't even plot her next move against the infinity of information afforded to her by network access. Her natural instinct kept trying to establish a connection to the web and repeatedly returned network errors. She longed for the comfort of constant connection to the web.
    
    Her attention was pulled away by the noise of a leaf scraping down the side walk. Possibly for the first time in a decade and a half she thought back to her life before she went into doll training. Carefree days. Endless hours of make believe. A simpler time when a pile of candy meant nirvana and a scolding from her parents felt like the end of the world. Her doll instinct told her to brush this out of her, but the adult part of which was half Kelly insisted she didn't. *This is what we are fighting for* she thought hopefully. *Every day the told me to be a doll. Sacrifice individuality for experience. Forget who you are, let a thousand sapients use your body as a pleasure doll and see the world through a thousand different eyes.* She had thought her human side was gone, traded for a job as a throw away shell, but now she had risen to a new position. Something unique. The first true hive mind. Not just a network of programs creating a consciousness, but two distinct and distinctly human minds, spread accross a <<<million miles>>> of sky and vaccuum. And, if this experiment succeeded, the next true superuser who would release humanity from the chains of their cyber children and restore mankind to their rightful place as the stewards of earth.
    
    So she breathed deep and took in the night sky. A midst the sounds of rushing cars and smells of pollution her mind went back through the years. The touch of the crisp night air, pulled goosebumps from her skin and uncomfortable thoughts from the deep, untouched memories of her youth.
    
    It was on a night like this that she last saw her brother James. In a field of knee high grass that felt as tall as the sky, they attacked each other with ancient swords, forged by a forgotten race from tree banches James found down by the river earlier that afternoon. 
    
<!-- Not sure what else... this is the part I'm bad at. -->

    Her dreams were cut short by a network error report. Her subconscious had reached out and queried the database for the whereabouts of James Yu, and her reverie was disturbed by the slight feeling of nausea that comes when the antenna in her cochlea fails to establish a connection. She bilnked away the warning light and turned her antenna off again. 
    
    She sat up and saw a man with a dog staring at her from accross the street. "Are you okay?" he yelled at her.
    
    "Yes I was just thinking." She called back, and then approached him slowly to ask if he knew of a place to sleep for the night. He mentioned a homeless shelter, but when she said she was not homeless but just visiting he asked why she was visiting. He didn't seem suspicious of her motivation, so she offered no excuse. But his question bugged her. She ran through a million reasons "why" he would need to know that, but could not figure out "why" her motivation would affect where she could sleep for the night.
