Enter Shiva
========

  Finally we reach the point that I enter the story. Rushing toward the grave and away from a difficult birth, my story begins, as most do, with my mother. She was, while she was still living, a cosmologist turned guru. Or maybe a guru turned cosmologist. It's hard to nail down which was her initial fascination and which drove them mad. Maybe for her they were the same thing.

  Her most notable achievement was solving the crisis of many bangs.

  As a child I would have terrifying dreams, existential crises that would send me running half awake to her bed side. "It wasn't real," any sane mother would say to her frightened child. My mother would try to reason with the nightmare. "What did you see?" she would ask matter of factly in a voice that betrayed how deeply she was asleep.

  "I was a colony of ants," I remember telling her on one occasion, sobbing into her night gown. "I ate myself and then our house and then the world!"

  "Do not cry my child, you have done no wrong," she insisted and then lie back down to rest.

  "But I ate everything!" I pleaded.

  On nights that I wouldn't give up she'd shake off sleep and speak in her physiscist voice and put on her guru face. "You almost had me there for a second, young Shiva. You know you can do no wrong."

<!-- fun exercise: rewrite these notes in first person!! -->

<!-- her mother always takes away a small black rock that she carries around. She then finds another and claims it is the same rock. Shiva (no actual name, always just the narrator) claims that it is the same rock. "Then I must get rid of it again!". Shiva is convinced that it is this behavior that made her insane, but alternately claims that this behavior prepared her for the ascention to the godhead. -->

<!-- Shiva runs away at a yound age (maybe 9?) and never returns. On the night she ran away she was convinced that her mother was watching, and no attempt by her mother to search for her was ever made. Years and years later (just before the asylum), Shiva learns of her mothers death and hunts down her lover who watched her die. She discovers her mothers last words were something to the effect of "It spoke to me to. Every time I took it from you I tried to get rid of it, but it always came back. I threw it into the ocean, a volcano, and even into space, but it always came back. I tried to lift this burden from you. I even begged it to take me instead. But we cannot change our fate. The only thing uncertain about the future is our knowledge of it. The rest is decided." Her lover just thought she was delerious.-->

<!-- Shiva spends most her life trying to forget about the rock and the voices that come from it, which become louder with puberty. She burries most of her teenage years in drugs and self hatred, "in the tradition of our race", using similar terminology later to describe her doctors hedonistic holliday in between hospitals. She drinks until she can ignore the voices and does drugs to turn them into a million colors instead of sounds. -->

<!-- When she sobers up and insists she be admitted to a hospital for people who believe that they are computers not humans, she finds that the doctor she was seeking (the rock told her his name) is leaving. She begs him to stay, but he only has a week. She asks him to turn on her network permissions. "but can't you do it if you are some powerful computer god?" he asks and I say "I cannot in this form, and She won't do it for me. She could, but that would be like burning down the house and sifting the ashes to find your car keys. Besides, she says I need to learn." -->
