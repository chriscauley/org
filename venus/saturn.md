  "I'm wiped" Jan said after a moment. She dizzily sat down in a chair and began writting as much as she could of herself into the ships buffers. "I've invalidated my key chain. If I return I'll no longer have any authority on Terra, Venus, or this ship. INSERT_NAME almost asked about her authority on Mercury, but then realized that she no longer knew about any of that due to the wipe. He and the rest of the crew verbally said their good byes and Jan offloaded herself to Io inbetween pulses. Her body slouched over and fell into a deep coma.

<!-- maybe not have this next part, save it for the return trip? -->

  "Well," INSERT_NAME said after a long silence, "how long before we know anything?"

  "She won't arrive for around an hour thanks to the light barrier," INSERT_NAME responded. "By then Jupiter will be so active even kilobyte streams will be impossible. We may never hear from her again."

  Amanda rose up and floated to one of the walls, "I wouldn't be so sure about that." Her normally shakey demenor vanished and she spoke with complete confidence. She met INSERT_NAME's befuddle gaze. "What's wrong don't you recognize me?" He pulled out a blaster and fired at her without hesitation. He didn't know what was going on, but clearly everything had been compromised: Jupiter had a spy with them all along. 

  Amanda jumped pushed off the ground, dodging his bullet. Before she hit the opposite wall the lights began to flicker violently as Amanda wrestled for control of the ship with him and everyone else. Simultaneously the rest of the crew all began to shoot and lunge at her. After a brief struggle she escaped deeper into the ship. ANOTHER_NAME managed to take out all wifi on the ship, but not before Amanda sent out a short transmission, a small sub megabyte package, a tiny packet of light racing toward Io, light seconds behind the digitized mind of Jan Yu.


Jan Yu on Io
---------

  Yu arrived on Io expecting a fight. She immediately locked herself down and began frantic inspection of the hardware she had been loaded on. But for all her searching she could find nothing innocuous waiting to corrupt or control her. The bulk of the systems immediately surrounding her appeared to be completely unprotected and open to anyone who wanted to run on them. Apparently AIo was so confident in his spy bots and root kits running back on Terra that he didn't feel the need to secure his own domain. 

  But her confidence was soon shattered when a very ominous message came <<<?down the wire?>>>. It was addressed to her and came from the same port she entered in on. 

```
Hey babe. Just wanted to make sure you got in safe. Everyone flipped out and attacked us once they realized we're not just some dumb meat suit. I've attached their attack plan. This will come in real handy eventually. Trust me.

XOXO,
Yua
aka. Jan Yu
```

  The message was signed with her own private key and included a 4D map showing a series of objects being shot at a central point and multiple stick figures charging the spot. A second file also detailed a network attack pattern with architecture earily similar to the ship she just left. She then noted that  the 4D map had the same number of people in it as the ship she was on and one person sat still in the corner. *Maybe he's not just a man in an empty castle* she thought as she reinforced all the security measures throughout her self. The task before her seemed impossible. Whoever was in charge of the Jupiter project clearly had access to her own ship and a copy of her (supposedly uncopyable) private key chain. And to make matters worse he was simultaneously flaunting it and allowing her to roam freely in his front room. But she had no choice but to press on.

  After she had secured herself as much as possible, Jan queried the nearby nodes for any sign of programs complicated enough to answer her questions. She found one such program running nearly twice as many processes as she. She immediately moved into the node and opened up a line of communication. `Busy and unable to answer your questions. Please wait and a more advanced copy of myself will be along shortly` came the response. *Jupiters about to fucking blow up, I don't have time for this* she thought inwardly. She sent a wide array of cryptographic attacks in a the hopes of annoying him into talking to her and instantly found herself in a VR environment with a male figure. Rushing around and fixing things, he spoke without looking at her.

  "I told you I'm busy and doubt I can answer your questions,"  he said with stong annoyance. 

  "Well when will you not be busy?" she demanded. A large book like object appeared infront of the other AI. It sprung open into a series of fractal holographic pages that looked more like a pop up city than the contents of a book.

  "Let's see," he said, querying the book in front of him. "Jan Yu, ASI[1] from terraIt looks like we meet once and only once in three decades in my subjective time."

[1] Artificial Sentient Intelligence

  *Three decades!* she thought. *Jupiter will be gone in a week* Nonetheless she decided to play it coy. "Well, what is that in <<<?objective time?>>>?"

[?] FactualError: This term has no meaning on Io.

  He huffed in annoyance, a completely unnecessary gesture inside a virtual world. "It looks like about three minutes in your subjective time. Like I was saying, I am just a fork sent here to do some repairs in anticipation of the shockwaves destroying this moon. My core will get to you soon. Now if you'd excuse me..."

  In spite his curtness he seemed very obliging. He could have just as easily put up a fire wall and ignored her. So she thanked him, exited the VR and explored the IRL[1] room that the node they occupied was next to. It was actually a large series of cells, about 2mx2mx3m in size, each containing a bed meant for a human to sleep on and a tray of food. In a few of the rooms, there were people pressed up against the ceiling, holding their ow weight by pressing their hands and feet against the walls. It had the feel of a prison or a research lab, she couldn't decide which.

[1] In Real Life, of course.

  At almost exactly the time the last program said, a larger version of the same program entered. This program was definitely a full fledged ASI and more; she could hardly begin to estimate its size. A cursory spidering showed that it extended into many neighboring nodes and even had connections to an equal number of nodes that she couldn't see as existing. When it saw her it centralized it's processes above one of the occupied jail cells. The network above another occupied cell began to ping at her violently, pleading her to enter. She mimicked the other programs configuration above her own cell and found her self uncontrollably and entirely sucked into the mind of the doll. 

  She hit the ground with a light thud, almost relieved to be in a human body again, even if it was not the one she was born into some thirty years ago. The gravity and pressure on the moon was significantly less than she was used to but she the doll she was in seemed very well acquainted to it. Her muscles (or more accurrately his muscles) were strong from constantly holding himself aloft on the ceiling. The room looked like a midieval dungeon, with thick bricks, worn by time and an odd feel of damp in the air. She stood up, brushed herself off, and went to the door. 

  "Hello, and welcome to Io," the other doll proclaimed, proudly holding both of his arms out and turning as if to offer the moon for Jans approval. "You come on the eve of my greatest accomplishment. Soon the transformation will be complete. A partical accellerator larger than the earth itself. Man has longed to answer one question: What the fuck is going on in the universe? Where the fuck did this come from? What the hell is existence doing here and why in Gods name is there anything rather than nothing?" As the doll spoke Jan was overwhelmed by a large ammount of factual information about the two objects (black holes, apparently) orbiting inside Jupiters atmosphere. It was worse than they estimated. In a few weeks time the black holes would collide and release a pulse of energy larger than the sun gives out in a year. Terra, Venus, and any other planet with an atmosphere would have it swept away into nothingness.

<!-- more here maybe they jump back in time? maybe they already did while she was "waiting"-->

<!-- Need lots of stuff about how this is the only time they will meet. IO explains time travel to her. IO also doesn't know about the previous encounter with the fork of IO. The fork mustn't have thought it was "worth writing down". Jan asks IO what program is running on the black hole, he accesses the last thought he has on Io, right before the moon is destroyed. In accessing it he is erasing it, which he seems not to care about, and finds out that he writes himself into one of the balck holes. IO seems unconcerned with not knowing who the second black hole is and also is non-plused at having read his biggest secret to a complete stranger. She asks, why he can't just write the secret down again for other parts of himself to read later. He says he can, but he obviously won't and leaves it at that -->

<!-- IO tells Jan that, according to his big history book of memories, that she is in charge of making sure that the explosion doesn't damage too much. He then leaves her and she spends weeks of subjective time (now 30 years in the past) working on the problem. At one point she listens to radio broadcasts coming from earth. She hears news about the pandemic spread by the titan (the one later trapped on the moon) and gets depressed. Scanning the airwaves she finds another frequency on a forgotten satellite that (probably) no one is listening to playing "music just for her". Based off of Satellite Mind by Metric :) -->

<!-- IO reappears shortly after she finishes her calculations. He seems to not recognize her (copy dialog from the boy in Waiting for Godot?) and says he is there because his logs say this is where he learns when to initiate the black hole. He shows her in his big book that this is the only time they meet that he has record of. This is the moment that she realizes that he is not a evil genius but an child-like scientist (a debate she should have had for the entirety of her stay on Io). She proclaims hes is no superuser, which does not throw and error flag, and then proclaims that there are no superusers on Io, which throws an error flag because in this time her pub key is valid and she is a superuser. -->

<!-- oh that would be nice to show up front. When she arrives she can't access anything. The fork, IO-a (which also justifies Yu-a), tells her this is because her pub key was invalidated as of the time she left Saturn (a security measure by herself in case she became compromised), and so he takes her back to a time when her pub key is valid to wait for the IO-core. IO core takes her back to a few weeks before he calculated the time to initialize the cataclysm (which is some 20-30 years ago) so that she can calculate the above.-->
