  "I'm wiped" Jan said after a moment. She dizzily sat down in a chair and began writting as much as she could of herself into the ships buffers. "I've invalidated my key chain. If I return I'll no longer have any authority on Terra, Venus, or this ship. INSERT_NAME almost asked about her authority on Mercury, but then realized that she no longer knew about any of that due to the wipe. He and the rest of the crew verbally said their good byes and Jan offloaded herself to Io inbetween pulses. Her body slouched over and fell into a deep coma.

  "Well," INSERT_NAME said after a long silence, "how long before we know anything?"

  "She won't arrive for around an hour thanks to the light barrier," INSERT_NAME responded. "By then Jupiter will be so active even kilobyte streams will be impossible. We may never hear from her again."

  Amanda rose up and floated to one of the walls, "I wouldn't be so sure about that." Her normally shakey demenor vanished and she spoke with complete confidence. She met INSERT_NAME's befuddle gaze. "What's wrong don't you recognize me?" He pulled out a blaster and fired at her without hesitation. He didn't know what was going on, but clearly everything had been compromised: Jupiter had a spy with them all along. 

  Amanda jumped pushed off the ground, dodging his bullet. Before she hit the opposite wall the lights began to flicker violently as Amanda wrestled for control of the ship with him and everyone else. Simultaneously the rest of the crew all began to shoot and lunge at her. After a brief struggle she escaped deeper into the ship. ANOTHER_NAME managed to take out all wifi on the ship, but not before Amanda sent out a short transmission, a small sub megabyte package, a tiny packet of light racing toward Io, light seconds behind the digitized mind of Jan Yu.


Jan Yu on Io
---------

  Yu arrived on Io expecting a fight. She immediately locked herself down and began frantic inspection of the hardware she had been loaded on. But for all her searching she could find nothing innocuous waiting to corrupt or control her. The bulk of the systems immediately surrounding her appeared to be completely unprotected and open to anyone who wanted to run on them. Apparently AIo was so confident in his spy bots and root kits running back on Terra that he didn't feel the need to secure his own domain. 

  But her confidence was soon shattered when a very ominous message came <<<?down the wire?>>>. It was addressed to her and came from the same port she entered in on. 

```
Hey babe. Just wanted to make sure you got in safe. Everyone flipped out and attacked us once they realized we're not just some dumb meat suit. I've attached their attack plan. This will come in real handy eventually. Trust me.

XOXO,
Yua
aka. Jan Yu
```

  The message was signed with her own private key and included a 4D map showing a series of objects being shot at a central point and multiple stick figures charging the spot. A second file also detailed a network attack pattern with architecture earily similar to the ship she just left. She then noted that  the 4D map had the same number of people in it as the ship she was on and one person sat still in the corner. *Maybe he's not just a man in an empty castle.* she thought as she reinforced all the security measures throughout her self. The task before her seemed impossible. Whoever was in charge of the Jupiter project clearly had access to her own ship and a copy of her (supposedly uncopyable) private key chain. And to make matters worse he was simultaneously flaunting it and allowing her to roam freely in his front room. But she had no choice but to press on.
