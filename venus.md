    The first time Kelly tried to get out of bed she sat up too fast. In a panic she tried to rush out of bed. Bolts of pain shot through her spine and all of her ribs. Her head filled with the sensation of fog and she blacked out before she even hit the pillow.

    This time she lay still, afraid to open her eyes. Days must have gone by unconscious because the pain had mostly subsided, yet she could still feel every needle they stuck into her spine and every bone they cut open. "What the hell did I sign up for?" she tried to say out loud but the words stuck in her dry mouth.

    Finally she opened her eyes and scaned the room. 
<!--
She looks around, better than her jail cell back on earth. Maybe it was worth it after all?
Describe the environment. Now windows. Subtle tremmors. No noise.

    She returned to the table with the eye contacts case, picked it up, rolled it around a few times in her hands, and put it back down. She did the same with the note on the table, but the only words written were "Instructions in eye contacts". *I guess not much else need be said* she thought. Hell even her father had refused to use anything but email and TV chat for most of her life. Even he had started wearing after the takeover.

    So she popped open the case and pressed the clear plastic into place over each eye ball. They were thin and unnoticeable and powered up almost instantly. *Spare no expense for the heros of tomorrow, I guess*. She chuckled bitterly at her own joke. The whole world would be watching as the scum of the planet colonized another world. A modern ship of fools; the brilliant and the expendable sent to their certain doom so that one day corporations could finally escape earth and spread accross the solar system.

    She blinked through the modes of the eye contacts, even more impressed than before. IR, sub-IR near UV, far UV, x-ray (seriously?), pan spectrum, edge emphasis, velocity estimation, content tagging, fast parse/grep/save... Kelly was impressed and that was not easy. She had used most of these prior to incarceration, but to always as separate contacts. Estimating the price of such a modern miracle, a wave of dissiness swept through her. Even lowballing it, she probably had several times her estimated lifetime income resting gently on each eye ball. Two miniture fortunes for the express purpose of spraying [laser light][] and augmenting vision for little old her. 

[fpgs] # "fast parse grep save; a reading mode. maybe keep or not?"
[laser light] # "contacts are actually passive, they function by tuning light that comes into the eye."

    After she blinked back into vis-mode a green glow appeared in the corner of her eye. She immediately turned her whole body to invesigate, but the glow stayed fixed in the same spot in her vision. *Muggle move Kell* she scolded herself. *Has it really been so long?* She unfocused her eyes and begin and turned her eyes down toward the pulsing green light. It began to grow, filling her view field, ready to pop. Before the message opened she thought better, refocused, and the pulsing jade shrunk back down to a [dot][]. Green meant low priority. In actuality she was not required to ever read the message. She could even delete it. And if they made her rat in a cage she could rat back by not responding to their tests. Ignore the friendly notices and wait for the messages to become blue, yellow, red and evenually black.

    She even thought to blink away the message, then decided to ignore it and fain ignorance. "Lights" she spoke, the first words from her mouth in days (months?).

<!-- the room lights up and she works out for a while, hungar prompts her to read the message. -->

[dot] # "Later she reflects on this and is happy she had the skill to close a message before opening it."

________

    It felt like hours passed waiting for the jade dot to appear, even though she knew that green notices would spool up a cron.30 once dismissed. She tacitly counted the minute pulses. It had to have been at least an hour since she last dismissed it. Finally she blinked into cron-mode. It had in fact been an hour twenty since she last got notice. Were they testing her? Did **they** somehow sense her rebellion and decided to respond in kind?

    Finally the jade returned. Angrily she blinked it away and immediately regretted it. "Fuck!" she said under her breath. She was hungry. Not hungry enough to pull it up manually in [talk-mode], but still painfully hungry. Suddenly the dot reappeared, pulsed green once and then shifted to yellow. Her pride would remain intact; **They** must be in a good mood.

[talk-mode] -mode for communcation, -cam for vision?

    She unfocused and pulled up the citrine message. "Yes?" she said indinantly, knowing full well that speaking to a message had no effect. Words rapidly filled her view, letter by letter.

\[\[Welcome and good morning. For more rapid communication a familiar will be generated. Blink to continue.\]\]
She focused on the blinking full cursor and blinked.

\[\[You will see a cycle of non-real images appear via eye contact and tacit response will be used to select the best familiar for you.\]\]

Blink!

\[\[If unfamiliar with eye contacts, this could be disturbing. Please ready yourself and blink twice to confirm.\]\]

    *They must really think I am a muggle.* She sat in the chair and looked at a wall. Suddenly a flash of pictures appeared in the white space, too quickly to recognize. As the cycle slowed she thought she saw a cat and grimiced at the idea of seeing **that** for weeks of training. The cycle continued. Dog, fox, wolf, some kind of hell knight, demonic robot; finally it settled on a dog skull with clown eyes and comical features. It's right horn was turned up and the left down. Dull pink smoke drifted from its mouth as if the virtual creature was breathing. *Got to give the psyche bots credit*, she mused. *They know what I like!*

\[\[Familiar 0863xA3 selected. d-blink to accept. s-blink for manual selection.\]\]

BlinkBlink!

\[\[For sufficient band rate audio permissions must be shared. d-blink to accept. Unfortunately rejection has been disabled for lack of persone-\]\]

BlinkBlink!

    Again she became aware of the pain in her bones and thought back to the mountain of wavers she signed when accepting her sentence reduction. Had they really forgotten to include pub-key access amongst the releases for experimental full body bone marrow replacement, lung scraping, rights to chemical intake (wtf...), and the millions of phys-augs they did to her while comatose?

    "Thank you and good morning!" the skull said, trilling over it's words and spining in plane in front of her. "You have successfully unlocked familliar access and inner cochlear communication. Your rate of completion for this task is in the *ZEROTH [PERCENTILE]*." His last two words were spoken by a stale female voice. *And I thought they were high tech* she thought, realizing that everything said must be pre-recored for each avatar. She then gloated inwardly about her ranking. There were supposedly three hundred prisoners selected for the experiment. By comming in last she felt that she had some how won, as if a bonus acheivement should be awarded for having a percentile equal to the number of fucks given.

[PERCENTILE] Be sure to mention that ratings are educational and not used to determine rank or pay.

    "As you may have guessed, your current status of *LIVING* indicates that you survived all of the physical augmentations necessary to undergo collonization. You may notice daily subtle alterations to the environment. This is to acclimate you to your destination." Both of the horns of the wall image became downturned and his jaws slacked as if frowning. "This may result in illness or death. But don't worry." The cartoon perked up and his horns wiggled excitedly. "If the acceptable death rate is exceeded, the mission will be cancelled, your physiology will be returned to as earth-like as possible, and after a brief parol period you will be pardoned. Would you like to begin training as a *CUSTODIAL TECHNICIAN*?"

    "What!?" Kelly screemed, half conscious of the fact that she was screeming at non-sentient tutorial program. "I get busted for cracking the second largest security protocol, jailed for black-hacking, and then win the lottery to die some fucking rock a million klicks away from home," an amber warning poped up to correct her math, which she angrily blinked away, "and my job is going to be space janitor?"

    Skull head shuddered and shrank to a point. A second later he appeared again with a smile on his face. "The leaders of Explore Incor. would like to remind you that every job is important. We acknowledge your skill as a *BLACK HAT [HACKER]* but feel your skills would be better served in another position." He paused as if loading his next thought. What is powering this piece of junk, cassette tape? "I mean, there aren't many *COMPUTERS* for you to *BREAK INTO* where we're going, do ya feel me?"

[HACKER] What about placing the girl voice \*Like\* \*THIS\*?

    She sulked, not breaking eye contact with the floating skull conjured on the wall. "And if I refuse?" she said in a threatening tone. Any person would have cowered at her quiet rage. Her piercing eyes and locked jaw had stared down parents, teachers, wardens, prisoners, and almost even frightened off the NSA agent who had arrester her. But this thing - a cartoon front for a pile of one's and zeros visible only to her and her alone through eye contact - this thing would not be intimitated.

   "*ONE MATCHING QUERY FOUND*" the girl voice responed. Then he spoke again, gregarious as ever under her death stare. "Would you like to review the last time you asked this question, or would the question re-evaluated for contextual changes?"

   She blinked twice and a green notification appeared. This time pulling it up caused a panel she had previously been unable to open to glow. She walked over to it and it slid open. Inside were full immersion glasses, which she put on without hesitation. The message paged, and she found that a video had been placed in her box. "Lights" she said to the ceiling and the lights dimmed. The glasses lit up with unfocused light that her eye contacts focused and readjusted as she looked around the room. Looking at the edges of her vision, where the glasses did not project, the room was black as night.

    But looking ahead she saw the room fully lit, only now it wasn't her hospital room. It was the interrogation room at the prison. She turned to her table, which was now the rectangular plastic table (complete with ash tray and coffee mug!) from the prison. The glasses projected a man. Clean cut, nicely dressed and responsible looking. Normally Kelly would never look twice at such a tool, but this tool claimed to be her ticket out of prison. She looked at the table accross from the square and saw the back of an inmate. The inmate had a frail frame, now-greasy once-beautiful hair, and miraculously still soft skin. A lump appeared in Kelly's throat as she looked over the girls exposed arms. They were a galaxy of scars. Tiny pink ribbons from fights with other inmates. A large gash on her right shoulder from when she crashed her bike when she was eight. And a series of slowly healing lines at her wrists. Kelly walked up to the fantom in the chair and looked down at her simulacrum. It spoke with her own voice, weepy and tired but somehow not broken. "Why me?"

    "Well as you know Luna was colonized by prisoners. Exploration Incorporated, then a subsidiary of Twitter, first tried to send scientists and engineers, and the first wave failed because they were not able to handle the conditions so-"

    Kelly's ghost cut him off. "No, I mean why me specifically?" By this point real-life Kelly had walked around the table and was staring in disbelief at herself staring in disbelief at the suit. Still she could remember the confident smile he gave her at this point. That was burnt into her memory; no need for full immersion glasses. 

    "Your prison files are public access and we know your dark past and the damage you caused. But we don't view this as a crime so much as a vast potential without a creative outlet. You'll most likely not even be hacking if you work for us. I mean, there aren't many computers for you to break into where you're going. But we feel that once on Venus you'll rise to what ever challenge is put infront of you. Criminal turned superman."

    He asked the question very sincerely. But his charismatic grin only angered her then and the memory of it only angered her now. Kelly was no longer looking at her twin, now stewing accross the table, taking a drag from her cigarrette and trying to choose between taking The Man's offer or breaking the ash tray on the table and using it to cut his throat. Real-life now-time Kelly now stared at the back of his projected head, tempted to scream all the things she wanted to scream now. No one would hear but Mr. Skullhead, but that would still mean admitting to herself how much she cared. She knew at that point she was making a pact with the devil. She knew that by leaving jail she would never be free.

    "And if I refuse?" she mouthed the words along with her shade.

    Suit boy shrugged and raised his hands. "The choice is yours-" he began but she cut him off.

    "No I mean what if I don't play ball? What if I get there and decide the game isn't for me?" Real life Kelly blinked to pause and walked again behind herself. She sat down in the chair over top of her own image and placed her arm next to her own. Old her was battered and weak, yet some how still strong in her resolve. The very resolve she would soon sign away in a million printed wavers. Now-time Kelly's arms had filled out and tonned. What ever miracle treatment they had done to her, she had awoken both Sleeping Beauty and Lancelot. She matched posture perfectly with herself and she saw the infected mess of scars she tore open every time they let her out of solitary. But those scars were only on her double.

    She blinked to play, now speaking for herself. "What if I refuse?"

    The man smiled his adversarial grin. "It's the exact opposite of here. No cops, no wardens, no adults to whip your ass and send you to your room. No one but a few hundred cons further away from authority than mankind has ever been." He sat back gloating. "But at the same time, you have no choice but to play ball. It is the only game on."

________

Kelly sat at the table, still shaking with rage over the images replayed as if from her own memory. Part of her rage was certainly reserved for the "government", whatever that was these days. But most of her hatred was caught up in her own self image. She agreed to this. She signed up. There was no one to blame for her lack of freedom other than herself.

When another panel opend up she almost fell over in her chair. The smell of food overcame her and resurrected her forgotten hunger. She lunged at the plate, all self consciousness forgotten. Face half burried in the best food she had ever tasted, she ate. 

<!-- go into the food a bit more? her senses are now super sharp because of the "retooling" of her neurology -->

________

<!-- A few days after gaining admin status, solar winds die down and communication to earth is regained. In the iterum she wanders through everyone's private lives and goes offline after finding out how open everyday dealings have become. -->

    Kelly threw open the doors with a commanding calm. She had been logged off for hours and, with the net carefully erasing her presence, her whereabouts had been the topic of much speculation in the interum. How she was aware of the meeting was her knowledge and hers alone. Not even access to her private key could take that from her. 

    "Well," she demanded naturally, as if it was her turn to speak, "You've been talking about me. That much is obvious. Let's hear it then." She was one of them now, and yet something new entirely. Her mind could run from corner to corner of the ship, even bounce off nearby satalites if she pleased. But she still sat offline, more comfortable in the "real world" and unconcerned with the thousands of ping per second exchanged between the homo-simacrula before her. Yes, she was something new entirely.

    Condescendingly and casually, Viki finally spoke up. "Of course, the whole ship has thought of little else all day," and then she bit off "your grace".

    In the corner Marx, whom only hours ago Kelly knew as a cleptomaniacal son of a banker, shifted in his chair. She was unsure if such motions were involuntary or if the dolls were fucking with her all over again. Under Kelly's steady gaze he volunteered, "We've finally come back into yacto-bit-per-second range of earth again." He looked down and cleared his throat. *So life like!* "We thought it best to appoint your new promotion as soon as possible. In order to put it behind us as quickly as possible. As you can imagine they are not pleased." He was so focused that Kelly hardly recognized him, although his head still tilted slightly when he was thinking too hard. *More like processing to hard.* Kelly allowed herself a chuckle at her private joke. "Suggestions range from isolating you to killing you, which are both not allowed under law."

    "Good to hear," she snickered. The dolls were obviously uneasy at her joke.

    "The most calm suggestion is to have you return to earth. While obviously impractial given our current distance and lack of personal transport, we have agreed that this would be in everyone's best interest."

    "But like you said it's impossible." Kelly whiped away the yellow light correcting her. She must have accidentally logged back on. "We're barreling to an uninhabited world a trillion miles away from earth." And another yellow light, this time correcting her poor human estimation skills. "The ship isn't even capable of turning around!" This time, much to her suprise, there was no correction from the anonymous skore keeper in the ships cores.

    Marx lit up with an almost human grin. "You really don't give us enough empathy, Kelly. We really are more alike than you think. Sure we dolls were born with a vastly different biology than yours, but our hardware is virtally the same. We were raised with a certain... intimacy of the information around us, but you could still do most anything we could."

    Vickie walked over and put her hand on Kelly's arm. "We can't send your body back, and most of your individuality is permanently hardwired," she paused to meet Kelly's gaze, gently smiling as only can an old friend. "But the part of you that you consider most... 'you'... The essence that makes you who you are is just an abstraction layer on top of a million other abstraction layers ending in neurons and electrical impulses."

    After a long pause Marx stepped forward and Kelly, paranoid Kelly, concluded that all of his manerisms were set to get her attention. This was obviously his realm of expertise. "With your permission I would like to put you under, lift off the top layer of the meta-ego, and send it back to earth." His grin widened at her shock. "Of course we'd like more time to train you but. We think by suspending your main processes-" She pulled back at these words. He stepped closer and grabbed her with both hands. His grasp was friendly, sincerely so. In his eyes he showed that he was on her side. "In your sleep we'd like to send you to earth. You'll be put in a doll and introduced to AI who we think you can prove your worth to. They can't harm you under law and we believe you can win them over with your case." He grasped her hands firmly and drew them together. "But we can't do any of this without the highest level of conscent. Every accesible part of your soul needs to be reached to be sent to earth, so we need you to trust us."

    "And I can trust you not to just botch the job and psychically lobotomize me?" Her voice trembled with the fear that she would even consider such a thing.

    "We do this all the time and we're certain that we can safely do this to a human."

    "Have you done this to a human before than?"

    "Kelly, there has never been a person like you before. We've never even thought to try."

    "But... I can trust you." Marx nodded reassuringly. "And you'll be there to put me back in when I get to earth."

    "No, the transfer has to be near instaneous. I'll be here and other AI technicians loyal take care of you when you land."

    She pulled away in disgust, but he held her tightly, never loosing eye contact. "You expect me to trust machines I've never met before?"

    His stare intensified as he drew her in by her hands. "I'd trust them with my life. And they're not just machines you've never met before." She looked down in fear, but he caught her chin with his hand and met her eyes again. In his eyes she saw every passion, concern, fear and hope. Every aspet of humanity gazed back at her from dark circles shrouded in gray irises. Search as she might she saw no quantum dots or micro transisters. Only care. "They're people. Like us."

    The room hung on that final word. "Us" wasn't the **they** Kelly was fighting against. It wasn't just four human bodies running highly optimised code. Us meant five, as much the human born Kelly as one with the others. Us did not divide but rather included. Tears ran down her face as she finally looked away and nodded once, once again signing everything that now one could take away to the mysterious rulers who displaced man on the throne of the solar system. But she was not afraid of deceit any more. She nodded because he meant it when he said she could trust him. He meant it and she believed him."

    The operating table pressed firmly against Kellys scapulae under the acceleration of the ship. Suddenly she was aware of a thousand noises previously underneath her newly improved senses. Tiny vibrations, probably caused by debris colliding with the ships sheilds, sizzled through the ship every few minutes. She pulled up her audio logs. Not every few minutes but every few seconds. What ever drugs they had her on were not sedatives.

    Marx walked in the room and set down a clipboard. She gasped as it echoed through her brain and then sighed as her gasp came to life. "Not the most plesant cocktail I'm afraid." His voice was like a choir of avalanches. "Unfortunately were not trying to put you under, but wake you up. We'll chemically lift your psyche out from its roots until you begin to wander through the nets. Then we catch you and wisp you off to another land."

<!-- trying to leave her body feels like passing through a circular hole. The door she needs to go through is much too small. Like pressing a water baloon through a golf hole. She ends up failing and they try again in hours. -->

 <!-- when she gets to earth she is supprised she is not tired. Tiredness lies mostly in the body. She's again shocked when she is tired when she gets back to the ship.
