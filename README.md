Chris Cauley's org repository
===

This is a collection of org files and other tools for me, Chris Cauley. While it is probably of little use to anyone else I decided to write this README any how.

Files of note:

howto.org - a collection of notes I've gathered over the years. Mostly just packages to install and common tasks I do.

books.org - books I've read. Now depracated in favor of app I made.

ln.sh - create symbolic links between this repository's rc files (.bashrc, .screenrc, and .emacs) and the home directory

durga.md - Notes for a novel I'm writting

venus/* - another file I'm writting
