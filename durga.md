Durga arives at IO for the first time
_________

    By sending out tracer packet Durga mapped the metal cylender descending into Io. Pings were rerouted back to her showing a dense net of micro computers lining the entire coldren. 2^20 micro centers traficked information throughout the structure and made small measurements Of the state of the electromagnetic maelstrom in the center. 2^14 centers stimulated the coldren, providing enough energy to stimulate the molten rock. 2^9 centers harvested the excess thermogravitational energy and powered the base below. All together there was more processing power than than her ship several thousand times over. 

    She rechecked the numbers and found that the entire system totalled more than 2^28 data cores. She checked it again and again and every time found that she had located only one part in two-hundred and fifty six (2^8) in the total system lining the power station. Investigating the positioning system she found billions of errors showing that the cores claimed to be located between zero and nine meters into the magma and maelstrom itself. "Impressive" she thought "either the remaining cores are built on machines ablet to withstand such temperatures or computer processing was being done within the magma currents themselves.
