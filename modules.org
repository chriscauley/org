* Ask Paul
  how do you like my css (all in one file, element specific not generalized)
  how do you like my models (extended the EPModule model quite a bit)
  i had to limit the number of picks in an odd manner. see EPM.get_picks
** javascript issues
   Many inputs are hidden from view of the editor as they choose modules.
   This allows for editors to generate validation errors, hide the inputs and submit.
   Row cannot save, but validation error will be hidden.
