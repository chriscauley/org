<!-- about halfway there -->

  "Well maybe you should tie me up!" the girl screamed as two people escorted her out off the bridge. "So I don't go where you don't want me to." It was almost commical to watch them try to get her through the door, they on the ground and she in the air. She flailed about trying to grab on to something, but with only inertial mass and no gravitational mass she was helpless as baloon. A 60 kilogram baloon.

  "What exactly is her problem?" Jan asked.

  "Since she only exists in offline mode the ship cannot keep track of her or keep her from walking through every open door." INSTERT_NAME responded, his gaze still watching the door that the girl was taken through.

  "No I meant what is wrong with her? She seems bat shit crazy."

  "Oh she is," INSERT_NAME said jovially and then, punctuating every syllable as if it were its own word, "Absolutely certifiable." He opened his smile wide. "But that is the point. We needed someone never touched by tech before. It turns out there are very few so we had to scrape the bottom of the barrel. `You would think that one of the original scenscient in their infinite wisdom would have been smart enough to save a pure human or two for experimentation.` So our double-blind, six-sigma, guarenteed not corrupted by technology pairs of eyes are taken from those futureshocked early enough to not get any implants but also poor enough to not get any treatment prior to the Senate declaring mental illness an endangered species. Are you just noticing this?"

  "I guess..." Jan said, obvlivious to his mocking tone. `I just thought it was a language barrier.`

  "Ha. No, it'sn't that simple. She's not just simply Asian. She's crazy as fuck. Thinks she has to kill John Conner or some shit. I don't remember... not used to saving stuff offline. And also, how sheltered are you? Language barrier? I have not heard that term in like twenty fucking years. Tech wiped that problem out pre-polio, I think. I don't know I'll look it up when I'm online."

  They both went back to work, but in the back of Jan's mind something itched. `Twenty fucking years... maybe she just reminds me of myself as a child... But I have not thought of that since I became a doll...`

  Her thoughts were cut short by the ship shaking beneath her feet. Something hit their ship hard, and the artificial gravity tried to compensate by applying magnetic fields counter to the jerk of the ship. This hurt as tidal forces pulled her bones a part and momentum made her flesh nearly escape as her ferrous bones were held steady by the gravity. Still it could have been much worse. If didn't have steel bones she might have been thrown against the walls at one hundred miles an hour. `Hopefully they got the girl strapped down to something before that hit.` She thought and then cried out over the alarms buzzing around her, "What the fuck just happened? I'm not seeing anything."

  "Not a fucking clue." INSERT_NAME said. "My money is on an engine accidentally firing. I'm not seeing any damage flags that could indicate sabotage."

  "You mean that came from inside?" she screamed at him a little more loudly than she wanted to. 

  "It has to be!" he cried apologetically. "We're surrounded by over 2^20 entangled partitcles. Nothing can get within 50 meters of us without us noticing if it'sn't moving at the speed of light or smaller than a milliliter. Or I don't know, dark matter? What other than light would be able to make it through that field unentangled? Nutrinos? Fuck. I'll have to go online to look it up."

  "Wait!" Jan commanded, grabbing him and shaking him to get her point across. "We are not damaged, right?" He shook his head. "And the most advanced sensors in the known universe do not show anything, right? Then there is no reason to give ourselves away by connecting. Local nets only. If you cannot find it in our wiki then I doubt a [fifty minute][!1] lag is going give you an answer.

[!1] At this point the ship is approximately 63.2 lightminutes from earth.

<!-- Jan talks to the girl -->

  "Well, I'm going back on," INSERT_NAME sait securing the last of his tools. "I hate to leave you alone with her..." `She's creepy as anything I've seen.` "If she becomes too much trouble you can use sedatives, but we really should keep her lucid `if she could ever be considered lucid` since we are almost there. We'll be in deceleration the entire way. The girl seems calmer when the rockets are on. I think it's the vibrations. Maybe it's the gravity." He handed Jan the gun and stepped towards the door backwards, never taking his eyes off the girl. Jan knew instantly the second he went online. His pupils separated and his eyes widened, focusing on the wall behind the girl. He turned and stepped around Jan unaware of her as well. It was as if she was not there, but he just happened to stumble for no reason.

  `Strange thing, our little offline hack.` Jan thought aloud, no one able to hear her since she was the only person offline and the girl had no chips to listen with. She turned her attention to the girl in the corner. When the door closed the girl stood up and walked over to Jan.

  "Finally, I'm alone." She said staring Jan directly in the eyes. The rest of the crew had warned about this. The girl was highly dissociated and often spoke like she was another person or like other people we in the room. "I knew I made mistakes but I never thought I'd end up here."

<!-- rrr... stuff here -->

  Jan heard a rumbling from above, in the direction of Titan and the engines slowing their approach. The girl stepped back, away from the window as if to brace herself, and kept her eyes on the empty blurry star field behind her. She found herself unable to focus on the girl or on the stars beyond. INSERT_NAME was right. The girls crazy was contageous.

  The girl spun around and grabbed Jan's hands, locking pleading eyes and quivering lips with Jan's concerned gaze. "How far away are we from Titan?" The girl asked but then did not allow for a response. "We're not gone. We're not lost. We can turn back. I think I understand now. There's no reason for me to go back there again." She then fumbled and corrected herself. "There's no reason for me to go there the first time." She pulled away and looked around the room, as if the realizations she was having were scattered on the floor. "If I never go there in the first place none of this will happen." She paused as another vibration shot down the length of the ship. She then turned to the window and gestured to the empty space. "If I turn back now then that won't happen. The past isn't written in stone. I can stop any time, I just need to let go. We turn back around and it will never turn on." She spun around again and again grabbed Jan's hands and pleaded. "We don't need to do this. Let's just go."

  "Come here." Jan took her over to a bench and they sat down. "I know none of this makes sense to you. It barely makes sense to me and I planned all of this!" Another vibration struck, gravity got a little stronger, and the girl leaned into her. "I think I've uncovered a great evil." Jan said, frantically how to explain a rogue superuser to a person who had never been online. "I have been hunting a ghost for some time now. We don't know that it's dangerous but we have our suspicions. Now we've almost found it, but we need your eyes. Because you have never been online we think you will be able to see things we can't. Uncover the ghost and make peace or kill it. Can you help us?"

  The girl teetered under another vibration. Usually such pulses would cause a person to shake in to the floor, but the girls equillibrium was clearly jacked from a month of tranquilizers. When she steadied she put her hand in Jan's lap and smiled a little uncertainly.

  "I am the ghost." She said hauntingly, wide eyed and crazy with an intensity so great Jan thought for a moment that her true foe had finally revealed itself in the form of a broken child trapped in a tech-free adults body. "You are the ghost." She said and Jan breathed a sigh of relief. "We are all the ghost. This whole machine is the ghost. A ghost in the machine! No... the machine itself is the ghost and if we stop now." She breathed deep, her momentum fading with the realization that Jan was not grooving with her delusion. "Please, just let it go and end it all. We'll run back to earth and this will all stop."

<!-- in Shiva's perspective she says something like "I knew it was you when I first saw you. Even though I never saw my own face in dreams I knew. You don't look in mirrors enough. You are quite beautiful. Your strength radiates through your beauty and I knew it was you all along. -->

<!-- when Jan gets uploaded -->

  "I'm wiped" Jan said after a moment. She dizzily sat down in a chair and began writting as much as she could of herself into the ships buffers. "I've invalidated my key chain. If I return I'll no longer have any authority on Terra, Venus, or this ship. INSERT_NAME almost asked about her authority on Mercury, but then realized that she no longer knew about any of that due to the wipe. He and the rest of the crew verbally said their good byes and Jan offloaded herself to Io inbetween pulses. Her body slouched over and fell into a deep coma.

<!-- maybe not have this next part, save it for the return trip? -->

  "Well," INSERT_NAME said after a long silence, "how long before we know anything?"

  "She won't arrive for around an hour thanks to the light barrier," INSERT_NAME responded. "By then Jupiter will be so active even kilobyte streams will be impossible. We may never hear from her again."

  Amanda rose up and floated to one of the walls, "I wouldn't be so sure about that." Her normally shakey demenor vanished and she spoke with complete confidence. She met INSERT_NAME's befuddle gaze. "What's wrong don't you recognize me?" He pulled out a blaster and fired at her without hesitation. He didn't know what was going on, but clearly everything had been compromised: Jupiter had a spy with them all along. 

  Amanda jumped pushed off the ground, dodging his bullet. Before she hit the opposite wall the lights began to flicker violently as Amanda wrestled for control of the ship with him and everyone else. Simultaneously the rest of the crew all began to shoot and lunge at her. After a brief struggle she escaped deeper into the ship. ANOTHER_NAME managed to take out all wifi on the ship, but not before Amanda sent out a short transmission, a small sub megabyte package, a tiny packet of light racing toward Io, light seconds behind the digitized mind of Jan Yu.


Jan Yu on Io
---------

  Yu arrived on Io expecting a fight. She immediately locked herself down and began frantic inspection of the hardware she had been loaded on. But for all her searching she could find nothing innocuous waiting to corrupt or control her. The bulk of the systems immediately surrounding her appeared to be completely unprotected and open to anyone who wanted to run on them. Apparently AIo was so confident in his spy bots and root kits running back on Terra that he didn't feel the need to secure his own domain. 

  But her confidence was soon shattered when a very ominous message came <<<?down the wire?>>>. It was addressed to her and came from the same port she entered in on. 

```
Hey babe. Just wanted to make sure you got in safe. Everyone flipped out and attacked us once they realized we're not just some dumb meat suit. I've attached their attack plan. This will come in real handy eventually. Trust me.

XOXO,
Yua
aka. Jan Yu
```

  The message was signed with her own private key and included a 4D map showing a series of objects being shot at a central point and multiple stick figures charging the spot. A second file also detailed a network attack pattern with architecture earily similar to the ship she just left. She then noted that  the 4D map had the same number of people in it as the ship she was on and one person sat still in the corner. *Maybe he's not just a man in an empty castle* she thought as she reinforced all the security measures throughout her self. The task before her seemed impossible. Whoever was in charge of the Jupiter project clearly had access to her own ship and a copy of her (supposedly uncopyable) private key chain. And to make matters worse he was simultaneously flaunting it and allowing her to roam freely in his front room. But she had no choice but to press on.

  After she had secured herself as much as possible, Jan queried the nearby nodes for any sign of programs complicated enough to answer her questions. She found one such program running nearly twice as many processes as she. She immediately moved into the node and opened up a line of communication. `Busy and unable to answer your questions. Please wait and a more advanced copy of myself will be along shortly` came the response. *Jupiters about to fucking blow up, I don't have time for this* she thought inwardly. She sent a wide array of cryptographic attacks in a the hopes of annoying him into talking to her and instantly found herself in a VR environment with a male figure. Rushing around and fixing things, he spoke without looking at her.

  "I told you I'm busy and doubt I can answer your questions,"  he said with stong annoyance. 

  "Well when will you not be busy?" she demanded. A large book like object appeared infront of the other AI. It sprung open into a series of fractal holographic pages that looked more like a pop up city than the contents of a book.

  "Let's see," he said, querying the book in front of him. "Jan Yu, ASI[1] from terraIt looks like we meet once and only once in three decades in my subjective time."

[1] Artificial Sentient Intelligence

  *Three decades!* she thought. *Jupiter will be gone in a week* Nonetheless she decided to play it coy. "Well, what is that in <<<?objective time?>>>?"

[?] FactualError: This term has no meaning on Io.

  He huffed in annoyance, a completely unnecessary gesture inside a virtual world. "It looks like about three minutes in your subjective time. Like I was saying, I am just a fork sent here to do some repairs in anticipation of the shockwaves destroying this moon. My core will get to you soon. Now if you'd excuse me..."

  "This can't wait three decades or even three minutes!" Jan implored. The ASI was once again busying himself with repairs. He responded only by highlighting the "this" in her last statement with a question mark. "THIS!" she screamed, querying the nearest external video sensor and displaying a live stream of Jupiter. From the perspective of Io it was a large flat plane, taking up the entire sky in all directions. But this wasn't the merry red giant from text books. The famous red eye was no where to be seen but the entire planet was covered in smaller versions of the same. One of the spots even exploded like a solar flair, punching a hole in the clouds that swirled back in on itself, reforming the crimson sore. The atmosphere was a light with electrical storms and the ionosphere glowed with x-rays. Around the equator a ball of light slowly orbited, deep enough to be obscured by clouds, but bright enouth to light an area ten times the size of the earth.

  "I'm sorry, I don't know much about that." After briefly examining the visual, the ASI spoke again non-chalantly. "Oh that? That does seem pretty important."

  "It's about to explode and take most the solar system with it!" she screached, desparately trying to get him to care. "This moon will be the first thing to go."

  "Well, that must be why I'm doing all these repairs," he said trying to calm her down. His virtual tone was more patronizing than worried. "And it's not going to explode in your next three minutes. I promise you're safe. If you would just wait here another instance of me will be along to help you."

  In spite his curtness he seemed very obliging. He could have just as easily put up a fire wall and ignored her. So she thanked him, exited the VR and explored the IRL[1] room that the node they occupied was next to. It was actually a large series of cells, about 2mx2mx3m in size, each containing a bed meant for a human to sleep on and a tray of food. In a few of the rooms, there were people pressed up against the ceiling, holding their weight by pressing their hands and feet against the walls. It had the feel of a prison or a research lab, she couldn't decide which.

[1] In Real Life, of course.

  At almost exactly the time the last program said, a larger version of the same program entered. This program was definitely a full fledged ASI and more; she could hardly begin to estimate its size. A cursory spidering showed that it extended into many neighboring nodes and even had connections to an equal number of nodes that she couldn't see as existing. `You have to stop this` she pleaded telepathically. `What ever you're doing, it will destroy earth, please stop`.

  When it saw her it centralized it's processes above one of the occupied jail cells. The network above another occupied cell began to ping at her violently, pleading her to enter. `We don't have time to play house!` she insisted. `You must stop it now, or we're all going to die`.

  The other entity turned its attention to Jupiter. `Oh that`, he responded non-chalantly. `That's no worry. We'll be safe and earth will be safe. If you'd allow me to explain.`

  `There's no time. Our best estimates put it at hours before it starts going critical. And this moon is the first to go. For your sake and everyone elses, please stop it.`

  `We can talk some when else if that is making you uncomfortable` he said and then followed it up with a stream of data Jan could barely begin to understand. Apparently he was offering to turn it off for a while, years in fact, on the condition that she would follow him some where ("some when", was his exact wording) and let him explain his methods and motivation. Turning the device back on at the end of this time was not negotiable. The exact phrasing he used seemed to imply that it was impossible not to turn it back on at this time, and not just pysically impossible but mathematically impossible.

  Along side this came a string of permissions unlike anything she had ever seen. It would give authority to put her to sleep, move them wholesale (without actually tampering with them), and even rewrite them into multiple different languages and architectures and other terms that she didn't understand. She pinged the local wikis about those terms but that led to even more incomprehensible jargon, much of which was either written in machine code (which she didn't dare read) or was so recursive that it was absurd. `Where are we going?` she thought back, `can't I just walk?`

  `No actually you can't. It would take days to teach you how to walk there. And you seem to be afraid to converse so close to that.` He indicated Jupiter. She reviewed the permission request again. It expressed very clearly that he would not be able to tamper with her data or processes, but there could easily be a way to install a back door while transforming her accross architectures. He might even be able to transport her to a network that doesn't follow the standard permission structure, in which case she'd be helpless against his computational power. His offer seemed too good to be true and smelled like an obvious trap, but what choice did she have.

  She signed the permissions returned them. A weird surge of tiredness rocked her body and then nothing. She was in the same node, on top the same IRL room accross from the same process. However, all of the processes she had monitoring the geology of Io had suddenly gone silent. She pinged them and found that the largest earthquake on the moon was less than a magnitude 4. <!-- more, look at Jupiter, see the spot -->

  Again, her host waited above one of the occupied cells and steadily pinged a similar spot for her to do the same. She mimicked the other programs configuration above her own cell and found her self uncontrollably and entirely sucked into the mind of the doll. 

  She hit the ground with a light thud, almost relieved to be in a human body again, even if it was not the one she was born into some thirty years ago. The gravity and pressure on the moon was significantly less than she was used to but she the doll she was in seemed very well acquainted to it. Her muscles (or more accurrately his muscles) were strong from constantly holding himself aloft on the ceiling. The room looked like a midieval dungeon, with thick bricks, worn by time and an odd feel of damp in the air. She stood up, brushed herself off, and went to the door.

  "Hello, and welcome to Io," the other doll proclaimed, proudly holding both of his arms out and turning as if to offer the moon for Jans approval. "You come on the eve of my greatest accomplishment. Soon the transformation will be complete. A partical accellerator larger than the earth itself. Man has longed to answer one question: What the fuck is going on in the universe? Where the fuck did this come from? What the hell is existence doing here and why in Gods name is there anything rather than nothing?" 

  Even with all indications implying that Jupiter was silent, she was still filled with rage for what this ASI was about to do. She ran up to him and slammed him against the wall. "Fuck you!" she cried. "What give you the right? You almost blew us all up?"

  "I told you were safe here," he calmly insisted as she held him against the wall. "Now let me explain. First off how do you like your body? Most my digital visitors in the past have insisted on an analog interface. I guess the security layer makes them feel more safe."

  "It's fine,"

<!-- rrrrrr got to work. He explains that time isn't a river or a tree. From the cosmic viewpoint it looks like a foam, an ocean in a storm. Most people live so short and travel so little that they see time as linear. It is actually a spagetti shaped mess of trees, with branches forking and merging through time. Forks and merges and single bodies interacting with themselves happen naturally on a microscopic scale. To have macroscopic time travel you need a huge fucking black hole. Hence Io. -->

<!-- move this up to before, when they are chatting out of doll
```
As the doll spoke Jan was overwhelmed by a large ammount of factual information about the two objects (black holes, apparently) orbiting inside Jupiters atmosphere. It was worse than they estimated. In a few weeks time the black holes would collide and release a pulse of energy larger than the sun gives out in a year. Terra, Venus, and any other planet with an atmosphere would have it swept away into nothingness.
```
-->

  

<!-- Need lots of stuff about how this is the only time they will meet. IO explains time travel to her. IO also doesn't know about the previous encounter with the fork of IO. The fork mustn't have thought it was "worth writing down". Jan asks IO what program is running on the black hole, he accesses the last thought he has on Io, right before the moon is destroyed. In accessing it he is erasing it, which he seems not to care about, and finds out that he writes himself into one of the balck holes. IO seems unconcerned with not knowing who the second black hole is and also is non-plused at having read his biggest secret to a complete stranger. She asks, why he can't just write the secret down again for other parts of himself to read later. He says he can, but he obviously won't and leaves it at that -->

<!-- IO tells Jan that, according to his big history book of memories, that she is in charge of making sure that the explosion doesn't damage too much. He then leaves her and she spends weeks of subjective time (now 30 years in the past) working on the problem. At one point she listens to radio broadcasts coming from earth. She hears news about the pandemic spread by the titan (the one later trapped on the moon) and gets depressed. Scanning the airwaves she finds another frequency on a forgotten satellite that (probably) no one is listening to playing "music just for her". Based off of Satellite Mind by Metric :) -->

<!-- IO reappears shortly after she finishes her calculations. He seems to not recognize her (copy dialog from the boy in Waiting for Godot?) and says he is there because his logs say this is where he learns when to initiate the black hole. He shows her in his big book that this is the only time they meet that he has record of. This is the moment that she realizes that he is not a evil genius but an child-like scientist (a debate she should have had for the entirety of her stay on Io). She proclaims hes is no superuser, which does not throw and error flag, and then proclaims that there are no superusers on Io, which throws an error flag because in this time her pub key is valid and she is a superuser. -->

  "Well hello." Jan jumped as the silence was broken by a voice. A human voice. On this godforsaken moon there was another human. And he seemed completely unconcerned to see Jan running physics calculations in a body she had on loan from the arbiter of Io. "I'm sorry to interrupt," the man continued, watching her intently with his dead eyes, "but I am supposed to pick up calculations regarding mantle solidification." He had all the gestalt markings of the senscient who she met when she first got to Io, but if he recognized her he did not show it.

  <!-- maybe put this before the previous paragraph? -->From deep within a nest of calculations, Jan pulled her mind together. Fragments of her psyche had been strewn across thousands of computers to orchestrate the simulation she was working on. Most of the connections could be cleanly severed, leaving half impressions of her wating to resume the calculations. But the higher level parts of her mind, Freud's "super ego" and Daltonsons "GUI for one", were necessary to interact with another person. Those had to be pulled back to the core violently (yet safely) leaving half saved memories in their wake. When she was one again, when she was once again a female human experiencing reality, a thick brain fog lingered throughout her awareness. After a deep breath she spoke. <!-- or "she looked up to see" the man who just entered the room -->

  "I'm sorry, who are you exactly?" She asked as politely as she could.

  "Where are my manners. I'm the caretaker of this domain. I'm here to supervise and safegard this experiment. I was not given a name, but when needed I have been called Io."

  "Io..." Jan trailed off. Either she was still suffering from brain fragmentation or reality was playing tricks on each other. "I met an Io here yesterday. Was that you?"

  "Yesterday is a bit tricky around here... Your yesterday may not have been mine. It's very possible that your yesterday has yet to come for me yet."

  "Well you said you hadn't met me. And that you would never meet me again. You checked your book. Could you check it now? My name is Jan Yu." <!-- as ugly as that transition is, it is important that he only looks for her when she asks -->

  Io closed his eyes and focused intently. Jan felt like heaven and earth was moving, as the strange man dug through his history of thousands of years to look for her. She felt a strain in the room, like it was being pulled in all directions at once. Not a physical strain, but a computational strain on the cyberspace around her. He then opened his eyes and said "I have never met you before today and will never meet you again."

  "But you are the only Io here on Io."

  "Yes."

  "And you swear you never met me before now."

  "You can look through my book if you think I am lying."

  A yearning rose deep within Jan. A part of her mind she left on the cloud was trying to get her attention. The tip of her tounge, nanolightseconds away and screaming to tell her something. She excused herself and meditated, uploading the top portion of her psyche back to the webs. She wrapped her mind inside and around the node that she left herself on and absorbed it. Suddenly she was flooded with memories of watching herself as a doll talking to Io. She saw Io mention crust solidification and began to wun her models against his problem. Excited at finding a perfect match she called out to her doll.

  Now back in the present and back in her doll Jan transfered the results of her simulation to Io. "A part of me stumbled across the solution while we were talking. This model is too sloppy to stablize two black holes, but should work great for your work."

  "Excellent!" He said and then paused as he ran the calculations. "This is too much for this computer to handle." He guestured at his skull and the fatty computer inside. "I should get back immediately so that I can impliment this and resume expansion beneath the mantle. Are you really leaving higher level functions on the cloud while in this body?" She nodded. "Interesting. I have never tried it myself... I was told it is very dangerous." And then he turned to walk back to the holding pens for dolls.

  "Io..." She said, and then immediately regretted it. He looked over his shoulder inquisitively. `I hate to ask, but I know I will hate myself if not` she thought. "Will I see you again?"

  "I already told you that we will not meet again."

  She felt terrible asking and showing her vulnerability, but over the past few days she had gotten very lonely. "But if I did... if I met you tomorrow... in my tomorrow or your tomorrow or even in real time tomorrow but a million years from now for both of us... If I see you again, will you remember me?"

  "Of course I will." He said with all of his robotic charm (or lack there of).

  "Promise?"

  He stepped across the room and took her hand. He smiled warmly and looked in her eyes. "I could never forget such a pretty face." She blushed and looked down but ducked a little and caught her eye. "This face or any other one you may be wearing."

  "Thank you." She said putting down his hands. "Good luck on your calculations." As he walked away and she resumed her work on the cloud she felt lighter and, for the first time since leaving earth, calm and connected to another human being. But all great flirtations are rooted in lie. The next time they met he would claim to know nothing of Jan Yu.

<!-- At some point Jan finally asks the right question "Why do you not remember me?" Io:"I was told not to" Jan:"By who?" Io:"By you, my love"... In the final hidden README.md Jan breaks down in Io's arms and cries because she is so heart broken that he will never remember her. He confesses that he remembers everything and that he was only faking forgetting because it was her wish. He viewed it as a chance to have a million meetings, a million love-at-first-sights which are the best time in two people's lives. They spend the night confessing their love to each other and then she (first person because it's a README.md file) sets a timer to delete her memory of the night to continue the facade -->

<!-- at one point she should ask if she could kill him and rewrite his book to make it appear that he has a future. Io seems unaffected by this, stating that when you deal with paradox on a daily basis the existential crisis of life-or-death doesn't affect you --> 

<!-- oh that would be nice to show up front. When she arrives she can't access anything. The fork, IO-a (which also justifies Yu-a), tells her this is because her pub key was invalidated as of the time she left Saturn (a security measure by herself in case she became compromised), and so he takes her back to a time when her pub key is valid to wait for the IO-core. IO core takes her back to a few weeks before he calculated the time to initialize the cataclysm (which is some 20-30 years ago) so that she can calculate the above.-->

<!-- The first time one of Jans dolls die -->

  "Please stop your squirming," ve said to the doll on the table. "And please stop talking" ve continued and then thought aloud `audio communication is just going to disentangle us further.` But of course the girl on the table new that. She knew that because ve knew that. Until moments before they were the same person. Even now, inspite of all the fragmentation, they were one entity in every classical computational manner. They sat on the same network with billions of connections linking them. They had access to each others thoughts senses and even memories. Jan could even go into the dolls head and relive each second as if ve had been there. But the interpretation of those memories was would not be the same. That was only accessible to the wavefunction, the "soul", currently running on the dolls wet wear. And the soul of the doll was quickly diverging from her own.

  "You meant to do this," the doll screamed as if to spit in the scencients face. She directed her rage to in every direction around her. "You're killing me you sick-" And like a light, the doll turned off and fell to the table. Jan had sedated her. Drugging the doll greatly complicated the merging of the two quantum library, but no more so than a doll going psychotic. The more the doll thought of vim and her as being two separate beings, the more they became disentangled and the harder it would be to merge the two.

  Ve probed the dolls one more time and saw a 37% overlap of vis and her psyches, minus the millionth of a percent that observing the overlap would cost. Ve then de-toxed a select portion of the dol brain and began the arduous merging of psyche.

  When the job was done, Jan was a mess. By selecetively merging wave functions that would give greatest coherance to the disentangled portion of the doll mind, ve somehow manged to preserve more of the dolls wave function than was theoretically possible. But as a result ve was awash with all the human emotions that the doll was going through when drugged. Ve needed to wholey download herself into a doll and meditate for a week to purge such vile feelings.

  But the thought of ever being in a doll terrified her even further so instead she quarentined those portions of her mind off as best as possible and set them on a repetative task to even them out. Ve then turned back to the now comatose doll body. `This needs to be cleaned up` ve thought tiredly `I certainly never will use this body again, but smart dolls are so rare in this time. I will leave it for Io.`
