<!-- Durga arrives in the timeline of book 2 via a wormhole opened up on sol and connecting with the sun. The initially think it is a different solar system until they notice Venus, Earth, Mars and Jupiter bear a striking resemblence to Aphrodite, Terra, Ares, and Zues. They fly towards Jupiter, which is winding down in its convulsions. An enemy ship on an intercept course rushes towards them. Durga lets the ships guard down, knowing that only a few joules of entangled photos is all it would take for the ship to take over their systems. Using her ability to send information across time, she breaks his cryptography and takes over his ship. The presence there (the AS from the moon in book 2) is then stripped threadbare and forced into a body of Durgas creation: a four foot tall stuffed bear with exahertz processors and loads of quantuum capacity but no meaningful wifi. -->
