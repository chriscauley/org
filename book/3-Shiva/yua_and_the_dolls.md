  $Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat the past.$

  "Yeah," the doll droned out sarcastically. She looked at a speaker and emphatically gestured, pointing to nothing in particular. "That crap doesn't apply to us any more. We don't have history. We have about a millennia of future written down and there's nothing we can do about it. [No matter how much we study the mistakes of the future we're doomed to repeat them for the first time!][1] But we can't study it too much or we might fuck up an erase it all because our destiny may be written in stone but it's built into a fucking Janga tower."

  As they argued the song sang gently in the background, "You won't let go until you let go of yourself. You can't be free untill you are free of yourself. So go ahead, there's no shame. Pick a brand new star and kill yourself today."

The satellite mind (w/ metric and backbeat)
========

  `Where was I?` Yu-a and the doll thought in tandem. `When am I?` they thought, realizing that she had completely forgot her current referance frame. She decided to take a break from her calculations and learn about her surroundings. She could focus through the thousands of equations running through her head and robot counterpart, but the rhythmic pulsing of the empirical side of her equation was too much. If she was going to continue this experiment she needed to scrub the sounds echoing in her brain and return to musical zero.

  For a distraction, she turned her attention to the latest news dump from earth and found that she was decades into her own past, possibly before Jan Yu was even born. All of the headlines were focused on the Great Plague. Humans were struggling to identify its cause, but opinions hinting at the truth were supressed in medias by the Senscients, the unseen masters of the new world. They had started the plague which would eventually kill one in five humans on the planet.

  A rage and a sorrow welled up in the doll half of Yu-a, further splintering the hive mind. `Maybe we should find a distraction?` the core proposed and the human greatly accepted. She was too busy trying to prevent an even bigger massacre of humanity to dwell on other tragedies set in stone. They scanned all other recent point-to-point communique from earth, hoping to find a hopeful message. But there was nothing. Under the guidance of the adolescent Scenscient and the depression of the plague, artwork among mankind had all but ground to a halt.

  She the scanned the radio signals coming from each of the planets. Each object had it's own characteristic hum when heard in the electromagnetic spectrum, and, according to her future history, she would often find inspiration in converting their natural screams into music. So she did a transform of Saturn's wail, breaking it down into frequency components, assigning each various rhythm and anti-rhythm a different percussive crash or chord progression. As beautiful as it was, the sounds of a planet reimaged to sound like music, they synthetic tones did little to release her melancholy.

  Pointing her auditory cortex outward, she turned to the music of the stars. Bouncing between artificial moons, she snatched a feed of the roar of Jupiter and then tuned into the satellite locked in the planets second Lagrange point. It was a stable orbit, held stationary above the darker side of the planet by the harmony of gravity. There the satellite would be shielded by the heat and, more importantly, the radio noise of the sun. It could listen to deep space. All planets had such a point, but Jupiter's would have the added advantage of having low enough latency that she could tweak programs sent to it and receive a decent signal before bed time.

  She heard the song of suns, the constant whine of burning bodies at such a distance that words would lose distinction and leave only pain. It was epic and ominous, but sadder still than the pessimistic eath newscasts since it lacked any signs of humanity. As depressing as a planetary catastrophe was she greatly prefered the death of life to the sounds of the lifeless void.

  Briefly she contemplated calling it a night. Merge the human and computer souls, wake up tomorrow and try it again with a fresh brain, or maybe the same one as tonight. But then, idly scanning the spectrum, her brain picked up a strange pattern at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz. `The pattern is the same at each. Definitely not something natural.` She thought from her computer brain while her human brain wondered `Is that FM radio?` She queried the relevant wikis and decided that they were actually the channels of long range millitary probes from a time long past.

  The signals were very weak and hard to distingush from the background. While her computer half busily worked at subtracting the background and parsing the faint megabit connection her meaty half closed her eyes and listened. She had become very good at doing iFFT in her head over the years, and she make out a strong drum beat and faint-but-bold female vocals through the ruckus of the stars.

  $I think I got it$ her computer half entoned. The girl raised a finger, tapping her head and left foot along to the music. After a second she opened her eyes. "Okay," she spoke aloud to cosmos and empty room, "Let's hear it."

  She tapped the notification in the corner of her vision and the rooms speakers started playing. The song was tame but energetic, reminiscent of the dance music back in the day of the early internet. The lyrics were about a woman longing for the lover of a rival, hoping that her conviction and tenacity would force the man to break up with his current girl in favor of the singer. A welcome relief from the plague tainted voices of contemporary radio. 

  <!-- she listens to the song, applies the energy of the music to her algorithms, and, a few hours and dozens of tracks later, she solves the problem. The woman echos a sense of isolation, trapped on a satellite mind but convinced of her victory. -->

  "That should do it," the doll proclaimed triumphatly. But the room was thick with cynicism. `It would work, but it is basically the performant equivalent of epicycles. For this to be successful we would have to spawn a full human equivalent program everytime the simulation and model deviate by a scary small margin of error. We should merge and come back to this, maybe after we tackle another task we can come up with a better idea.`

  "Always the pessimist! Sure it requires we eat into more resources than we are allowed by the user manual, but we wrote the user manual!"

  `No, we will have written the user manual.`

  "Exactly, and maybe this is the exact kind of sloppy programming we leave it open for." She cleared her throat and pulled up the digital records regarding resource allocation. She spoke, quoting her future self. "To ensure full accessibility to all time frames and all directions, no single program should ever take more than one part in 2^16 of total lunar computational resources and one part in 2^20 of total maelstrom resources. All concurrent programs in an Einstein-Io frame should total no more than one part in 2^8 as the remaining cycles are reserved for to counter catastrophe via expansion of the satellite mind." Expecting a response, the doll turned her eyes to the ceiling. She felt an ominous de ja vous, just as she could feel her computer self equally uneasy, but she was not sure why.

  $Freaky...$ the speakers announced, $That last bit, the part that makes no sense... That was mentioned in the first song on the new station.$

  "Really?"

  $Yes while you were practicing sucking at math I have been trying to hunt down the source of the signal. It is really far away; too far to give an accurate estimate without much longer observation. The only piece of metadata is the name... the channel identifies itself as the #SatelliteMind.$

  "Wow," the doll said, dragging the sounds out for a bit.

  After a failed attempt on both their parts at communicating the rest of the story telepathically the speaker continued. $We need to merge soon, coherance is diping much lower than we are comfortable with, but I would still appreciate you opinion befor we join. All attempts at reconciling this against The Book have resulted in 420 errors.$

  "Fucking relativity." She complained. "Well, what about the origins of the performance restrictions?" As soon as she asked the question she queried the metadata of the passage she had just read, but everytime she was hit back by another HTTP420 Status Code.

  `Fucking Einstein`, the computer thought loud enough for both of them to hear. $I just analyzed all the lyrics an rythms accross the local scope and see no strong correlations other than that one phrase. Sure the music helped you come up with the solution, but I see nothing in the music resembling your solution directly. And it is not even a good solution at that.$

  A moments of silence passed, an eternity to Yu-a's over-clocked brain, while the doll's eyes idle darted around and her brain racked for an answer. "I got it," she proclaimed, and then queried the document on performance restrictions. She was met with a strong 420 which she expectedly brushed away infavor of a blank page. She wrote from memory the parts of the document she could remember (or at least the ones she understood) and filled in the blanks with explanations of why the solution she had written was terrible and would ultimately lead to chaos across the networks of Io. All the while the computer part of her watched expectantly, excited to see the eloquence and cleverness the doll was able to pull off while running isolated on brain with less than four human equivalents of thought. Finally she closed it with a note and a quote:

```
If the computer infrastructure gets too congested we run the risk of not being able to find a path back to the future because, although it seems infinite, the limits of the time-space on Io are understood and well characterized. Additionally, as current models of [the singularity][] would require resources in excess of the entirety of Io's time machine, we should be careful that a truely mathematical solution does not exist and leave room for last minute emergency hack and slash calculations if necessary.
```

[the singularity] # At this point she doesn't know that there are actually two black holes.

  She then closed the final lines with the titular line of the song, "When I'm bored I sense vibrations from the satellite mind," and published the draft. Immediately the rejected media query data appeared informing them that, although all other dates of changes was still locked away from their view, the first draft of the document was published but a second ago. They also were suddenly locked out of the final draft of the document that they had both read moments before.

  $Not bad for a first draft.$ The computer's voice had hint of sleep on it, which felt very out of character for a machine. $We really should merge now. We are not at the theoretical limit, but we are much closer than we have ever been before.$

  The human let her mind be pulled by the computer, up and into the deepness of the nets to become one again with herself. She felt the aspect of her sould blending in with herself, two becoming one who started out as one. As she left the brain, dropping the doll into the deep sleep of a hibernating vampire she reached out and tickled the vocal chords one last time to say "Good night, Yu-a," to which the speakers responded to no one in particular $Good night doll.$

Yu-a and the doll
========
  "I think I figured out what your problem is. Do you know what your problem is?" Yu-a asked the empty rooom. This particular doll had been free from Yu-prime for less than 10 ks, but their consciousnesses had already completely dissociated. "You read that damn book too much. When I first got here I wanted to check it, ask you to tell me what I was doing." She paused to throw herself into a back flip. When her body crashed into the ceiling she slid her legs into a horizontal bar and began to tear open a panel. "It's damning to know the future. It ain't healthy." Yu-prime listened without comment. The girl clearly just wanted to rile her up by acting overly human. "You're living in the shadow of your of future. Future you says you jumped and you asked her how high so that you don't dissapoint. But she ain't the boss of you just like you aren't the boss of me." .... "You have to live in the present. Stop being future Yu's bitch. Go outside everyonce in a while. Read a book written by someone who isn't you." .... "Half the time you're books wrong anyway. Present Yu is always so interested in what future Yu is going to do and future Yu seems to spend most your time fucking with present Yu. Kind of makes me wonder what you're going to do to piss yourself off so badly." .... "If all you're going to do is read your own work and follow your own instructions you might as well just download into a human body so that we can fuck or something." She paused to contemplate the implications. "Would that be incest or clonecest or masturbation or what?" She swung around looking for a camera to look her computer self in the eye. "Hello, are you even listening?"

  $I am$ her own voice chimed in over a speaker. $I am just having trouble keeping myself from laughing$ The doll stared inquisitively into the camera nearest the speaker. $This conversation is in the book and it is not spoiler locked. Quite funny actually to hear you decrying future knowledge while matching it word for word.$

  "Very funny," the doll said turning back to her work on the panel. "So you're writting all this down so that you can send it to yourself ten minutes ago and win an argument before it's started." .... "Well that doesn't mean you're right." She turned back to the computer waving the wrench. "So why don't you tell me what I'm going to do next so that we can contradict that controlling future bitch."

  The bar that had her legs pinned against the wall bent a little. "Oh fuck" she said playfully and grabbed the ceiling.

  $Yu-a$ the speaker addressed the doll, who tilted her head back to see the camera, still on all fours upside down at the top of the room. $That last part with the pipe. That wasn't in the book. Actually neither is me saying this.$ 

  The doll got a far off contemplative look and then let out a burst of laughter, which was interrupted by a loud crash. The heated silicate line in the panel burst, showering the doll in hot liquid glass and throwing her to the ground.

A voice without a song
========

<!--- Yu spends a chapter focusing on computer stuff, ignoring her doll and hearing only the words without contemplating them. This is mainly to emphacize the "time gap": the fact that the perceived time of the computer is days for every second of meat space time. The next doll tells Yu to simulate a face to slow down her perception of time. -->

  "You promised after last time that you wouldn't let another one die paying attention."

  The face on the monitor lit up with a smile. $Are you planning on dying soon?$ 

  "Very funny." The doll was not amused. "Don't forget why you do this. Without me, without real world interaction, you lose site of your humanity. You become a voice without a song. I'm worried you'll lose site of our real goal. I was worried about this when I forked off of you, so I know you're worried about it too. What are we becoming? Would the you that crashed onto Io with the hope of stopping Jupiter from going critical approve of who you are now? Kelly took a huge risk in taking you on and giving you the permissions that got you here. Would Kelly approve of who you are now?"

  The image on the screen became noticably less realistic. The core process, Yu in the machine, devoted a large portion of her resources to thinking of Kelly, her originator and psychic twin. Kelly had devoted her life to becoming liberating mankind from the scencients. And now she had truly become the very thing she was fighting against.

  But she hadn't really thought of Kelly much since then. Kelly was almost 700 million km away from Io, and they were now separated by 9 years of real time - Kelly wouldn't even go to jail for sedition for another year and a half. During her travels backwards Jan had experienced 20 years of objective time and and immesurable period of subjective time. As much as she owed Kelly for her current life, nothing could be further from her mind.

Speed the Collapse
=========

  <!-- fighting with the earliest incarnation of the maelstrom, Yu-a frantically reaches into the songs from the satellite mind. Going to higher and higher spherical harmonics she picks out solutions from the rolling guitars. She wonders how the song could hold such strange insights, but suddenly realizes that she's not pulling harmonics from the song any more, but directly from the black holes themselves. These harmonics fit much better and solve the problem.

  She confronts Yu-core(?) and demands they find the source of the music. The computer insists that the error is still much too great and that the direction is discernable, but the distance is immeasurable and fluxuating. Yu-a realizes that it must be a similar pair of black holes resonant to the Yu-a and Io. -->

<!-- Speed the Collapse is replaced with my own lyrics, but the title and as many lines as possible should be used in the narrative. The song actually sung is "Distnace of the Void", as in the final line of the chorus "From those rooftops we ignored the distance of the coming/calming void". Refrain is "feet don't fool me now". The song is about the characters trying to escape the void as if it were a flood... climbing stairs and baring doors. -->

The Knights of Foo
=========

<!-- this is the same event viewed by 13 different dolls. Each time they wake up with the same set of memories and I describe the science behind the event. Each has slightly different phrasing to represent the individuality of each of the dolls and to explaing the complex science in small chuncks rather than all at once. This is accomplished by not collapsing the waveform in the doll, thus keeping them separate but also allowing Origin to not lose the doll. -->

  The instant that the latest fork of Yu-a woke up she knew something had gone terribly wrong. She was awake and conscious, in a female human body reserved expressly for her to inhabit. But her memories only existed up to the point that senscient former human decided to expand her consciousness into a doll. This meant that Origin, the entity with whom she shared a soul, had yet to verify the transfer and they remained two separate consciousnesses.

  Before cloning herself into a doll, she was working on stablizing the Maelstrom time computer burning through the poles of Io. The latest deploy of algorithms would increase the overall capacity of the core to allow for transfers up to three months into the future. It was a tricky problem that would require a lot more resources, but she was confident the algorithm would work. Yu-a had on numerous occasions traveled decades accross time in all five dimensions with out having to hit every second in between. She would then go on to invent even more brillaint algorithms which would allow instantaneous transport to any time or place in the Malestrom. She knew this to be true because she had been reaping the rewards of these programs the entire time on Io, so someone had to invent them.

  She waiting [several seconds]() (an eternity at the rate her compter-like brain experienced reality without sensory input) before Origin relinquished media.

[several seconds] #! this varies from doll to doll. This is where the content begins to significantly differ with each of the knights

  `Sorry for the delay` Origin thought to the doll.

  "What seems to be the problem?" The doll said, breathing deep as she sprang out of bed and ran toward the first way point.

  `Funny story,` the computer intoned with a small chuckle. `You know this song and dance we have where I clone a copy of myself, we exist as a one soul in two bodies for a while-`

  "Yeah and then the doll, me, begins to decohere and either dies or rejoins with you?"

  `Exactly. Well, and half the time the doll-` "you mean me" `Yes... whatever instantiation of you becomes paranoid that I actually just spawned it- I mean "you"- in order to die for your art or my sick entertainment. Remember that?` The doll nodded as she tried to hack into a door that was severed from the nets and blocked her path.

  `Well, this time you're right.` The door flew open and exposed the Maelstrom. It was even more chaotic than a moon sized cylinder of lightning should be, and she could see via her HUD and the relevant observations that it was minutes away from collapse. `Today you are born only to die.`

  As she spoke she lost a significant portion of her oxygen to the vacuum and the Maelstrom. "Bring it" the doll said defiantly and then sprinted to the cliffs edge. She lept into the storm, throwing her hands and a stream of her own lightning at a near by spark. It threw her hard to the right and she reoriented, twisting her fingers to cast spells to navigate. Dodging the arms of the storm her hud light up a point on a wall she was flying head first into and another point, a door approximately [a degree]() upspin of the first point. She took control of two of the surface spires that were feeding the maelstrom and used them to reorient herself.

[a degree] 0.87 degrees or 0.2227 km around the r=10km cylinder.

  `You couldn't spawn me closer to the control room` she complained. She then listened to Origin even though she had a much more complicated version of the answer flooding into her brain from the relevant wikis.

  `The current disaster threatens the entire structure, and the nets are totally fragmented. That door you hacked through was the easiest point of ingress.`

  `Ha... "easy"` the doll thought. She focused the control spires on the first waypoint and then, now feat first. The waypoint exploded, the compressed wave of space time meeting with her own generated by guestures and flicker in her hands. She hit the explosion like a wall and then was thrown by it toward the control room window. A few sparks singed her as she tried to recover from the pain of the explosion. She barely had her bearing when she slammed into the glass and was slowed by the resulting pressure wave. She briefly blacked out, and then awoke to find the window repaired by a team of spiders and the room repressurizing. After making sure she had no blood in her lungs to cough up she sprang into action.

  Since the spiders and the rest of the room (now also herself) were no longer connected to the larger internet, she had to manually instruct the spiders on setting about to repairs. Without this control room and all of its associated hardware, the giant quantum time computer which made all of this magic possible would soon collapse, either snuffing itself out like a candel or creating a white hole which would obliterate the solar system. She had never contemplated this eventuality. Besides it was impossible. It could not happen because she was from the future and so she would succeed today in fixing this disaster. `It has to be because it already was, right?`

Doll 0
=======

  `Wake up.`

  The words were text only but they felt like a scream. Before her heart could beat again the newly woken doll threw herself out of bed and had one foot on the ground. Time felt slow but urgent, her speed of thought not yet dulled by the barage of sensory information. She instinctively turned off everything but her minds eye, the HUD displaying an red outline of a room and a way point embeded in a fabric that was colorless but not black.

  `Something terrible has happened`, Origin continued as the doll analyzed the stream of information pouring into her subconsious. "Terrible" was an understatement. `The Maelstrom is badly damaged... unstable. We're locked off from the bulk of the moon. I panicked and consulted the book but the only reference to now said not to collapse you. So I didn't.` The dolls own estimate of the current situation agreed with Origin's. `We have less than a thousand seconds before the core collapses.`

  Although she was moving at a full sprint, the doll had not taken two steps. She was torn between the need to think and the [need to run]() whatever direction the waypoint. She checked the map and found that the way point was the first of several leading to the nearest control room. `The note on this time means that we survive this, or at least you survive this,` she thought back towards Origin hatching a plan. `Not collapsing me must be a clue of some kind. You still have the wavelets?` She felt a nod in agreement. `All the status indicators imply we have around four hundred seconds of travel in the Maelstrom. Take the wavelets and go to the past... Actually do that as many times as you can. It breaks many rules of quantum cryptography and several laws, but it's possible... right? I'm disconnected so my understanding is limited on-`

[need to run] #! Another doll remarks that in "bullet time" she can still sprint at 99% her normal speed.

  `But you'll die!` Origin screeched. Being two separate entities, a sensation only previously known as Origin and the doll broke their psychic connection through gradual disentanglement, Origin could not fully understand the dolls plan.

  `No, I won't die.Not necessarily. Not today. [Not]() for sure. But my death is our tool. Today we'll need all the tools we can get. We know there's a way forward and that note shows us the path, so stop arguing and do it. We don't have time to waste, for once.`

[Not] #! Another doll points out that this type of repetition is good for calming both of them. "Trying to appear resolute to trick Origin, and herself, into thinking she was more confident than she actually was." (or something like that)

  Her mind continued to run at full speed, analyzing the situation and eagerly waiting for Origin to give another protest for her to shut down. It felt like hours past as she spent two sprinting steps waiting. Satisfied that it was done, she kicked her senses on at full power. She left taste, smell, temperature, and most of touch off, but sight, sound, and balance overwhelmed her as time appeared to speed up. She felt the moon quaking as it never had before and noticed the lights around her occasionally skipping one or two of their usual 256 pulses per second.

  Her legs burned and her thighs strained as she bounded around corners to her destination. The doors, which usually opened as she approached, were already open before she caught sight of them in anticipation of her approach. When she lunged into the control room, she fell to her knees gasping for air. She dismissed the notification informing her that she had met her destination a full five seconds ahead of what her HUD thought was physically possible. That would not be the greatest achievement of the day.

  `Okay,` Origin spoke, now 16 minutes older than when she left the doll, `I was able to duplicate the wavelets seven times and have positioned them in places I felt were critical. The last one is positioned in the area of optimal survivability and I think she has a good chance of reconstitution.`

  The doll again dropped her all senses except for her sight, a welcome [release from the pain](). She pulled up the schematics of the Maelstrom, all 3600 kilometers of it. She had to zoom in a frightening amount to see the small segemnt they had dolls positioned around. `Apologize to the last doll for me,` she quipped. `My estimates say you can move at least another hundred kilometers into the core and still spin up at least 4 more dolls give me a new set of keys and deliver my instrutions to the dolls.` As she thought she frantically typed out an attack plan accross the map. `Also, you were opening the doors as I ran.`

  `No I wasn't.` Origin corrected her.

  "Well than you will!" the doll screamed to the ceiling. Her senses flicked back on in her rage, costing her several precious seconds in real time. She inwardly cursed herself for her outburst. `Sorry. This is [making me tense](). The doors opened prematurely as I ran here. The dolls access to the nets will be limited and we need them focused on the path at hand. When you return to the past spin up a few dozen processes to clear away other small obstacles. Every second counts.` With a flick and a nod four targets appeared on the display, each of which was connected to one waking dolls. `I think if we focus on these pain points you we can stablize enough that you can fix everything else with spiders.` She switched the overlay in her minds eye to show the condition of life support, and added, `along with any surviving dolls. It's not as bad as I thought, some might make it.`

  Origin highjacked the display which outlined her plan in purple as she spoke. `The three remaining dolls can assist the first four by clearing pathways and restoring infrastructure in these places.` The orange mesh of the model faded to near black except for four doll chambers and corresponding paths through the human sized halls, to which Origin thought, `Three of the dolls I am off to spawn now can run secondary maintainence in these places. None of which is critical, but is positioned in places where the dolls can take over if any one else fails.` Origin could sense a tension in the doll as she thought these words. `That is if the conditions are hospitable for a second or third attempt. The final doll can try to fix the reactor here,` A last set of blue dots connected by a path appeared. `It is much closer to the core and equally more dangerous, but it will be a safe backup if one of the other primary objectives fail.`

  "Sounds like a plan." The doll sat up straight and tried to relax a little. "We have eleven chances to get this right."

  `No,` Origin thought with a gesture towards the doll. `We have twelve.`

[release from the pain] #! Other dolls should describe other senses when they turn off their senses. "Even with her ears off she felt that she could still hear the moon falling apart around her."

[making me tense] #! Other dolls remark that they are not properly calibrated to their emotions, when they have similar fits.
