Finding Emily
=======

  At this stage in the analysis facial recognition was not allowed. Not that Jersey needed it. That stressed face but elegant gate. The motion in her steps of pure, undeniable purpose masking the exhaustion as she ran. The face was unmistakably hers. Jersey needed a way to proving to the rest of the world. Who was this mysterious woman running on top of a train at dawn? He would know her any where, even if she changed her look. But how could others see it.

  Then he saw it. One shot, probably inserted by the editors for this very point. The frame of the camera cut off the bottom of her face, leaving only soft blond hair that clumped like knives where blades should be and pale skin housing emarald eyes that could cut diamonds. That shot seemed so familiar. Maybe too familiar. If this was a clue by The Editors then he would not be the only person to see it. `I hav'ta work fast.`

  And so he exploded into a flurry of monitors, combing through every second of the b-reel and deleted scenes of the last season of, or more accurately the punultimate season of, his favorite now canceled RTV show. He knew every frame by heart, maybe better than anyone on the planet. Of course it could not be in the main reel, the 114 episodes everyone knew. But it had to be there somewhere. 

  He came accross a deleted scene of Emily and Henry running (`of course, running!`) up the stairs of a building. He watched it several times but could not find what he was looking for. He turned up only the audio in the new leaked footage and blasted it. Emily was singing loudly in the background music, inspite of the fact that she was panting heavily while running. [Prerecorded music][] was unheard of (borderline illegal) in RTV. `Maybe they are using her songs and a similar looking actress to lead into a new show?` he thought. The whole world had after all watched Emily fall from a building in one of the most disasterous moments in the genre. Maybe she was dead after all. "No she can't be!" he almost yelled but instead asserted under his breath. He closed his eyes and breathed in the energetic guitar of the music that so tightly resembled the train, a rythmic picking of strings that went click-clack in his ears.

[Prerecorded music] # When he calls her at the cafe she says that she will answer one question. When he asks how she survived the building she says she is hanging up. He blerts out "how were you singing on the train?" and she agrees to meet him. The answer is that she can sing in her head when she left RTV and the cameras pick it up via her neural net.

  Like a bullet train emerging from his minds eye he finally knew. He pulled up the final episode and skimmed along the unoffical footage. At this point the other three Fratellis had left her and she darted from rooftop to rooftop in unrelenting pursuit. It had to be Emily. Sword to one side and hair bouncing in a pony tail she moved with the same exact same gait as the woman in the leaked footag. The distance between buildings almost perfectly matched the length of the train cars so that from an aerial view the two could almost be superimposed. Almost, but that was not the shot he was looking for.

  Jersey sat patiently, digesting several tens of minutes of footage without blinking. His only breath was the occasional gasp when, after moving at olympic speed for an inhuman amount of time, Emily would leap again, falling some ten meters or more and then resuming her previous pace without missing a step. And then he saw it. For less than a second a frontal camera focused on Emily's eyes, mouth and nose cut off out of frame. He quickly tried to interlace the two and found that three steps of each footage matched perfectly, both with each other and with the drum beat, so that when he but between them in rapid succession they made the perfect transition.

  He then went busily to work, hours blending with seconds and minutes into a slurry of time that tasted like days and smelled of nights. He cut and sewed scenes together so frantically that he would often forget himself. Finally, he threw himself back satisfactorily in his chair and exhaled. He centered himself, trying to [displace his own memories] so that he could see what others would see when they watched it. After a few more calming breathes, he killed the lights and pressed play.

[displace his own memories] # Actually, change this so that he stashes all his memories of editing it and watches it for the first time with no memries of editing it (but still remembers seeing the train footage and song many times).

  He was shocked to discover that his masterpiece left the music wholly untouched. He somehow felt that, although they completely removed the ambiant audio, that the music was exactly as The Editors had wanted it and should not be touched. The video, for the most part, was also unaltered in time. The original motion of the girl (whose identity he tried to forget) fit so well with the music that he had not the heart to move any of her steps out of time to the song. He even went to scoff at himself and laugh his hours wasted since the first 30 seconds seemed untouched.

  But then he saw a flash. A tree passed in front of the camera and in the shadow the train dissapeared. For a fraction of a second, almost unoticably short, the scene was replaced with Emily running on the roof tops. It shot back to the white roof of the train and the hot sun, as she sprinted in the opposite direction the train was going. And every time any shadow would appear or some object would obscure a camera angle, there it was again, the long pursuit on rooftops in the final moments before Emily "died", and then back to her sprinting against the train.

  As the first verse crescendoed the flashes became much more intense, now following the drums rather than the random shaddows. Right as the drums peaked and the first chorus began, Emily jumped between traincars and buildings. In one fluid motion, night time Emily lunged forward and swung her blade. It cut into the camera and the flashes ceased, this time stopping purely on night time Emily. She fought her former friends. Jersey had seen this footage a thousand times before, but never had it been set so perfectly to song. She was always the best fighter of the four, but with three on one she was certainly doomed.

  When the chorus was almost over the bass drum kicked into high gear again and the flashes to the train started with it. Jersey suddenly recalled that this particular moment was the first time the static started interrupting the live feed of the show. And here the static was replaced by the scene on the train. `Either amazing at this or The Editors have planned this all along` he thought. Both seemed equally implausible at describing the tight cuts covering the static.

  And then Emily was back on the train. Jersey expected much more after this last bit, but the second verse [was mostly more of the same][]. He was disappointed but at the same time could not think of what he was missing. Nothing else could go there

[was mostly more of the same][] # Amanda later makes a much better second verse that gets her in with Emily. Also much of this section needs to be rewritten!

  The second round of fighting ended with Emily tossed through the glass window. That famous final scene, slowed down so that the glass bits floated around her and the static could be exchanged with her back flip off the train. As night time Emily cut out day time Emily completed her back flip and landed from one train to another. She stood up, sword on back, and looked back at the train she had just jumped off of and the city she was leaving. The music built in intensity but slowed down. Eventually the slowing won out and the music fade away as Emily sang the final ominous lines: "Like the moon we shadow a lie, I have fallen from my castle in the sky. And if you catch me I will survive. And together we can watch it burn."

  The camera panned around to face her front as she sang the final word, revealing the city and auroras behind her. Finally it fadded to black as she turned the direction the train was headed to face her destination.

  Beaming with pride and anticipation, Jersey hastily threw together a script to seed the video on a few key fan sites. `Got to get this up before any one else gets credit.` He motioned to launch but then froze. Something did not seem right. There was a larger piece he was missing. He downgraded his scripts to only post to a few of the deeper corners of the web and put it on a timed launch of a few days. If someone else launched before him they would get the bulk of the payout, but this way he would certainly get credit for first discovery.

  He restored all his cached memories and focused on a cached copy of the video. There were two unexplained mysteries that he noted early but never solved. Where was she going and why was she running on the train. After watching a few arial shots he answered the second question easily: the trains were moving in opposite direction so unless she at least matched the velocity of the train she was on it would be difficult to leap to the other train. But where did all this take place. The city she was leaving was obviously her home. He could recognize that from any angle. But he could not quite tell the second city. The buildings were so modern that it could only have been a handful of RTV locations. But he swore he knew all of those. This must be a new RTV series. 

<!-- blech, too tired to write. He recognizes the city as being a IRL city, is glad that he did not publish and decides to figure out where she ran to. -->
