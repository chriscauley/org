<!-- Far above the sun, Durga watches the conversion of the sun to a black hole. She is approached by another senscient who reports that many humans have, by a variety of methods, rejected salvation and condemened themselves to a slow death on the rapidly changing earth. When vi begins to rattle on about the new genetic treatments they are introducing to maximize human survival, Durga interrupts him and asks how many people will live. "The war is far from over, but the best estimates have human survival at less than a percent, a mere 19 million humans will survive." Durga says something like "Born in an apathetic universe among a chatoic world and an infinity of dangers, people have always sought the meaning of their existence. No answer has ever has ever really felt right because humans have no real purpose. Nineteen million is a good number for a fighting chance. Humans will always survive and will always continue to surprise us. In the end that is really the only thing that humans actually do." -->
