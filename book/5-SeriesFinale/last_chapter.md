  Amanda held her sword Emily's neck, pointing it down at a sharp incline directly into her heart exactly as Emily had done to Jersey months before. "Do it!" Emily screamed. "I am ready to meet my maker, I know I will be saved." Amanda stared into those eyes she hated for so long and wanted nothing more than to sink her blade and end her.

  But this was not the evil she was after. This was just the face of one of the many heads of the beast she sought to slay, and that beast wanted nothing more than to have that head severed. It would make a great story. Revenge always does.

  "No" Amanda said to the grinning martyr. "You won\'t meet any Gods today. But neither will I." She stretched out her arms and swund around. "Is this what you want? Is this all we are to you?" she screamed to the angles around. There were tens if not hundreds watching, some with in arms reach. In full panarama the beast watched hungrily from a thousand eyes, awaiting its climax. She swung her sword back up, over her head and gracefully into its sheath. She turned and walked back to the entry way where her pack sat discarded. Behind her she could hear the hobbled puppet struggle to her feet. "Do you think I want this?" She cried again to the angles at every angle. "Well I don\'t. You can keep your heaven." She pulled out a myo glove from the pack and put it on. It lit up, crackling with thousands of volts of energy and shocked the air. "I\'d rather die than stay in this play. Not your death. *Our* death. I won\'t play your part." A brief look of terror went over her as she held the maelstrom inches from her eyes. She composed herself and with one final voice declared, "I won\'t play this game."

  Amanda slammed the glove to her forehead and instantly collapesd with pain. Her body seized and writhed on the ground as blood shot out of her eyes, nose and ears. Inside her cooking brain, trillions of nano wires popped as the antenna connecting her to the other side disentigrated. Finally the glove shorted out and left her on the ground, coughing up smoke and blood.

  Emily stumbled over as best she could, dragging her own blade with both hands. With the same excited expression she wore when the knife was at her throat she raised her sword over her head and stared at her would be killer. With all her strength she drove the blade up, but then jumped back, dropping it to the ground. "Ow!" she said stumbling, trying to balance on her one remaining achilles tendon. A needle of pain was in her face and a bee buzzed around her head. As she looked for it she was suddenly swarmed by two, ten, hundreds of tiny angles, kissing her with their stingers and flying away[!]. She swatted at them and fell to her knees, then down on all four.

  The cloud vanished and Emily began to scream. Her head lit up and her head stood on end.

  The light blinded Amanda so she turned away, but when it died down Emily was beside her, looking into Amandas eyes with a peaceful smile. "Amanda, it\'s me." Emily spoke that a voice that was not her own. Deep in the face Amanda spent two years hating sat the eyes she had mourned for just as long.

  "No," Amanda coughed. "You can\'t do this. Please anyone else. Put him back in anyone else." But as she pleaded a spark lit up in her nemesis\' right pupil, and a tear of blood fell down her face. *It can\'t be undone* Amanda thought to herself. Instead of a tragic death, they had awarded. From within Emily\'s body her dead lover leaned over and kissed her, careful not to put too much of his/her weight on Amandas broken frame. Emily[!] lifted up to see Amanda\'s face torn and conflicted.

  "Don\'t cry. It\'s me, _____. You did it. We won, they put me back." But Amanda still saw the face she so hated. They would not give her a happily ever after, and she knew that for years to come, maybe longer, she would look into the eyes of her lover to see the face of her arch enemy. In a moment of enlightenment she looked forward and saw herself waking up with nightmares of the hell behind her only to see the vissage that tormented her at night. As much as she loved him-now-her, Amanda knew she may never be able to make it work, no matter how hard she tried to see through her memories and dreams.

  And in that moment of clairvoyance she chuckled at her own misfortune. This was not a happy ever after. This was not even a bitter sweet ending. *But it will make for great TV.*
