After Ava dies, Ava and Brandon have their timelines intertwined and mostly run counter to each other.

From Ava's perspective Brain teaches her to see in time again and live her art again. She panicks after seeing her own death and spends a few chapters going back to the scene, trying to understand it and stop it but always getting caught up in the moment. The 4th time she returns and finally gets a good count of herself. She can only count six of herself: Her original time seeing it, the four returns (including this one), and herself dying. She concludes that the next time she goes back she will die. She then meets Brandon who is fully trained in time walking and fights her. They plot and scheme running away forever. One day, she rescues Brandon from a near death at the hand of one of her past selves. From his perspective she's kidnapping him. Here she learns that another Belmont is going to do something near her death which only she can stop (betray the humans to the Scenscients in some way). She sees the whole picture (sans trance this time, but still with the "enlingtened feeling"). She then marches proudly to her death.

From Brandon's perspective, Ava kidnaps him shortly after her death. He develops stockholm syndrom and falls in love with her. He tries to convince her (who is unconvinceable) that they should run away from all this. They keep getting caught up in conflicts and Ava seems to be getting more erratic. One day Ava does not recognize him. He realizes this is their last time together and dances with her (which she thought was fighting when she saw it) one last time and then leaves her.

  "Can I see?" Ava said, almost snatching the sai from his hand. From an unseen dimension she pulled out one of her whips and began to move the sai along its length, comparing it to the black crystals held within. When she reached the end the whip retreated and another appeared. "I could have sworn..." she ran it along, trying to match it to each of the barbs. "Aha!" She proclaimed and then ran to him, setting herself down next to him and presenting him the weapons. He took the sai from her but hesitated as she presented the whip to him. "What? Are you afraid of it all of the sudden?" He tried to protest but again she cut him off. "It is the same thing as the [last time you held it][]. Are you afraid of it all of the sudden?"

[last time you held it] #Ava is referring to the whip, and in her version of the same chapter he has been with her much longer

  He looked closely at the blade in his hand and the black stone on her weapon. She was right, they were almost identical. He could even remember pulling it from the same spot in her whip on the day she died. He took it from her and held the two side by side, trying to superimpose them in his mind. She snuggled up close to him as if flirting with him, almost pressing her cheek against his. No, not flirting. She snuggled up next to him as if she no longer needed to flirt with him because they were already close. As odd as it was, it made sense. She was a time walker. He had witnessed her death days just days before, and now, since she was not bound by time, here she was - a "past" version of herself alive after her own death. Maybe she had known him longer than he knew her.

  For an instant he felt the same familiarity as she had shown to her, as if he could lean into her too and it would just be normal. But then another thought crossed his mind. *Or I could slit your throat while your guard is down.* He immediately suppressed the thought as if she might hear. In reality, he could not kill her. He watched her die so he knew for a fact she would not die right now. But he might. Given her superior combat ability and the fact that his time of death was unknown he knew the risk was unwarranted. 

  He almost jumped when he felt her hand on his, holding it as if it were part of the sai and pushing it closer to the whip. She turned his hand so that the same edges were facing eacha other and pressed them close. "There are gashes missing," he said excitedly. She hummed in the affirmative and then fell silent, turning the object in his hand with an air of anticipation. "The gashes are larger on yours!" He screamed in amazement. She said nothing, but grinned an all knowing grin. "That doesn't make any sense. I tore this piece from your whip and made it into a sai. And then..." he trailed off in confusion, looking away and confused.

  "And then you forged this weapon, practiced with your friends, and fought me a handful of times."

  He continued in utter disbelief. "And I have not sharpened it. So my blade is further in [its own subjective time][]. It should be more worn... But it isn't. So my blade is from the past?"

[its own subjective time] #When this line is said in her timeline she is happy that he understands the blade has its own time, rather than it being Avas time.

  He looked at her utterly confused, lost in paradox. She [grinned back][] with the patience and joy of a teacher watching a student about to get it. Finally she let in, saving him from his own confusion. "The blades don't have to move in time with us. Sure we drag them around, but some they can move backwards as we move forward, or any which way."

[grinned back] # From his perspective there should only be descriptions of her appearance and insight into his thoughts. Vice versa when the chapter is told from her perspective.

<!-- I'm getting side tracked from what I was going to write so I'm going to summarize. Some of this can be in his timeline or hers or both or maybe in other chapters. Probably here, but different stories in each time line.

  She tells a story of an expiriment where she tied a blade to the roof by a rope and then set the rope on fire. She ran down and found a dark spot made of the blades material in the rock. When the blade fell, there was a cut in the rock but the black spot was gone and the blade sharper. When he asks why didn't she do it again and try to catch it, she said she did, but almost cut her hand open. She was too afraid to try again.

  She also pulls up a programming interface and makes a demonstation of him of a pad of paper with a stick figure drawing. The stick figure is animated in a 2d world. The then shows a rod (paperclip), bent and curving in 3 dimensions, jammed through the paper. On some frames there are one or three or five of the rod as it passes through the paper, but only one stick figure. -->

  "It's amazing really." She said, curling closer to him, eyeing his sai and pressing her weight onto his. "Don't ya think? Seeing the same object at the same time, in two different times?"

  A dark thought occurred to him and he asked, "Have you ever tried it?"

  "Hmmm?"

  "Finding yourself in the past... have you ever been tempted-"

  She moved away from him, again adopting a teachers tone. "I have... I had visions. I've had many visions where I go into trance." She grabbed his arm exitedly. "I see everything. All of space and time in four dimensions and I see... I see it all." An ominous breeze picked up as she breathed in deep and then died again when she exhaled. "I guess I never contacted myself because I never saw myself interracting with myself... until that day... but then one time I came close." She adopted a far off look, like a soldier recalling the horrors of war. "One night it occurred to me that I could find myself and tell myself... things. I don't even know what I'd say to my past self, but it occurred to me. That night I had a terrible dream. I had a headache. I didn't actually dream anything other than having a headache. And being sick, a terrible nausiousness that felt like dying. I woke and heard someting in the bushes. Or at least I think I did. It might have been part of the dream. The next morning I figured this was my chance. To explore my own past instead of the past of the world. To be a part of my own journey. So I walked backwards and found the same spot. It wasn't easy. You know how big the world becomes when you walk in time." He did not know, but he also did not feel that it was worth interrupting her to say so.

  "So I went back to that same spot. And as I came close to where I slept I became sick. All I remember is collapsing and vommitting. I woke while it was still dark, and in a terrible haze I ran as far away from myself as I could get." He tried to imagine what she felt, but was too afraid. *What would I even say to myself* He thought. *Could I say anything? Would I just lose it?*

  They sat in silence, [trying to erase the conversation][] in the night air. "We're not meant to interract with ourselves. Freedom in time is not that free." Her posture changed again, now pleading as much as explaining. "And that's what they fear in us. The computers. That's what we have that they don't. For the longest time they didn't know how to send information back in time. It turns out humans do this constantly, experiencing the future as much as remembering the past. I guess that's why I got sick when I tried to visit myself. Quantum phenomena only exisiting in the absense of observation. But there can be one observer." And inbetween the lines he finally read what she had been saying all along. If a particle moves back in time and interracts with itself quantum collapse occurs. He felt like he was the first man to see into a forbidden abyss.

[trying to erase the conversation] # When she experiences this she debates telling him about going back and fighting herself.

<!-- he realizes she may not know of her own death. He decides not to tell her but instead try to rescue by taking her far away from here and now -->

  "What is it?" He said turning the matt obsidian shard in his hand.

  "Black matter," she replied with a hint of wonder.

  "You mean, like dark matter."

  "No," she said with a chuckle. "Dark matter is a McGuffin that scientists chased for a century. They knew the universe was missing most of its. The searched and searched and found nothing. But dark matter is just normal matter, near us in the time plane." He shot her a puzzled look so she continued her tangent. "When we walk in time we arrive in a place next to us but not in any traditional dimension. It can't be seen directly because of the way our brains were wired by evolution. An average person may wander a few kilometers in the time plane over their lifetime. This is why two people near each other can see the world so very differently. It's so spread out, locally, that its effects can't be felt. But if you zoom out far enough you'll see your world is much more massive than it appears locally."

  "I think I understand," he said, wanting to know more but even more curious about the strange "black matter" he had come weild but not comprehend. "Then what's this?"

  "This is black matter. An exotic, non-entropic substance which, I think, is created by high density computation. You have heard of Yu-a and Io?" He nodded, with a near inaudible grunt of affirmation. "When they created and detonated their black holes the amount of energy released should have destroyed the solar system. It nearly did. But much of the energy was spent rewriting the laws of physics. Altering the firmware of our corner of existence. That energy is bound in this. It doesn't experience time as an arrow, and information can exist all along it in every dimension. When we walk in time it leads us. Accross the time plane, exploring the larger, corner of our own personal earth and 'dark matter'. It opens the universe to us, and we are but the film in the camera observing a much larger world."

  "So this came from the black holes on Jupiter?"

  "Possibly, but I don't think so. There's more of it every day, maybe it's just the pieces of the black hole moving into the future but I doubt it. Some of the pieces spiral back to Jupiter, but I've seen accross time as the black matter allows. Many of these pieces do not grow and move back to the black holes, but grow into the future."

  "You want us to kill her." He said taking another drag from his cigarette.

  `Yes` the machines spoke through the airwaves.

  "You say yes, but I haven't said yes. Not yet." He said mid exhale. "Do me a favor... play a game with me." He paused for a second, knowing it would be an eternity for the machines. "You have, by my count, an uncountable number of sensors... monitoring the air currents, scanning the skies..." He paused again, knowing full well that an enternity of cycles would pass for the machines. They would analyze data and predict the future as he gathered his thoughts. "You see... everything. Subtle motions in the ground, the cadence of my breath... you even monitor my thoughts." In his imagination he pictured the machines pensive as he went silent. "You even monitor my thoughts."

  "In all this you predict our world like a clockmaker sees years into the future, but you cannot kill her." He paused just long enough to trick the machines into thinking he wanted a response. Right when they began to send a reply, when they thought their next words, he spoke again.

  "I'm going to toss my smoke in the air. A random direction at a random time. Can you hit it?" He took one last drag and held it, the machines knowing full well that he did not want a response. After an eternity he exhaled and, at a time he predicted most random, he tossed his cigarette in the air.

  Using his own predictive senses he reached out his hand in the darkness to the place his cigarette would land, under air resistance and a gentle breeze. A fraction of a second later his palm was showered with the debris of a smoke shattered by an unseen, unheard projectile.

  "Tell me," he asked, "when you shot that, how far away did you fire the bullet."

  `940m` responded the sterile text in his minds eye. He quickly estimated the maths on the back of an imaginary envelope. "Just under three seconds?" His vision was perturbed by a notification, a red correcion of a much more accurate number. "So you can predict me `you can predict us` an eternity into the future, by your standards. But you cannot kill one girl?"

  `Correct.` The machines paused, knowing that he was ready for more grandstanding. Old men do love their soliloquy.

  "I know something about your kind. I've studied between the lines and know you are forbidden to kill us by your own laws. But in the face of anihilation? You rule by consensus. Surely no one would protest if you take her out. Faced with your own demise, surely your [!!trillions] would agree to take a life?"

  The machines waited a few dozen seconds to reply. Were they thinking? Was such a question so difficult to answer that with several million humans worth of mind could not formulate an answer in real time? Or were they simply taking a page from his playbook, waiting to speak not out of calculation but out of dramatic flaire. `We knew that you were planning a "random" act 149 seconds ago. We isolated it to tossing a cigarette within 90 seconds and knew the exact trajectory (within an insignificant margin of error) within 29 seconds of the event. Given the chaotic wind conditions, the closest projectile launcher within agreeable confidence intervals was only able to move as far as 940 meters away before firing.` The words paused again, just long enough to make him uneasy. `But she posesses a new material unknown to us. We have been unable to study it because within any observable range computronium ceases to function correctly. Any observer we send is rendered... we would call it non-performant. You would call it insane. This material she posesses, most likely embedded in her weapons, seems to render all artificial thought meaningless. We depend on you to stop her because, just as it does not incapacitate your target, it does not seem to affect any natural born human negatively.`

  "So what, we depracate her, contain her whips, and then you deprecate us? Physical bodies will once again be out of vogue? What guarantee do I have that you won't turn on me if I eliminate her?" The machines began to speak again but he cut them off. "I think my best bet is to stop her from destroying "our" world and then use the weapons on you to protect "my" kind."

  `She is not the only source of this matter. You know that we have much to offer you. Since we cannot interact with this exotic material you now have something to off us. You need not fear depracation once your target is eliminated.`

  "My target," he laughed. "You presume too much. I have not agreed to help you."

  Without an instant of hesitation the machines responded `Not yet you haven't. But you will.`
