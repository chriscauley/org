After Ava dies, Ava and Brandon have their timelines intertwined and mostly run counter to each other.

From Ava's perspective Brain teaches her to see in time again and live her art again. She panicks after seeing her own death and spends a few chapters going back to the scene, trying to understand it and stop it but always getting caught up in the moment. The 4th time she returns and finally gets a good count of herself. She can only count six of herself: Her original time seeing it, the four returns (including this one), and herself dying. She concludes that the next time she goes back she will die. She then meets Brandon who is fully trained in time walking and fights her. They plot and scheme running away forever. One day, she rescues Brandon from a near death at the hand of one of her past selves. From his perspective she's kidnapping him. Here she learns that another Belmont is going to do something near her death which only she can stop (betray the humans to the Scenscients in some way). She sees the whole picture (sans trance this time, but still with the "enlingtened feeling"). She then marches proudly to her death.

From Brandon's perspective, Ava kidnaps him shortly after her death. He develops stockholm syndrom and falls in love with her. He tries to convince her (who is unconvinceable) that they should run away from all this. They keep getting caught up in conflicts and Ava seems to be getting more erratic. One day Ava does not recognize him. He realizes this is their last time together and dances with her (which she thought was fighting when she saw it) one last time and then leaves her.

  "Can I see?" Ava said, almost snatching the sai from his hand. From an unseen dimension she pulled out one of her whips and began to move the sai along its length, comparing it to the black crystals held within. When she reached the end the whip retreated and another appeared. "I could have sworn..." she ran it along, trying to match it to each of the barbs. "Aha!" She proclaimed and then ran to him, setting herself down next to him and presenting him the weapons. He took the sai from her but hesitated as she presented the whip to him. "What? Are you afraid of it all of the sudden?" He tried to protest but again she cut him off. "It is the same thing as the [last time you held it][]. Are you afraid of it all of the sudden?"

[last time you held it] #Ava is referring to the whip, and in her version of the same chapter he has been with her much longer

  He looked closely at the blade in his hand and the black stone on her weapon. She was right, they were almost identical. He could even remember pulling it from the same spot in her whip on the day she died. He took it from her and held the two side by side, trying to superimpose them in his mind. She snuggled up close to him as if flirting with him, almost pressing her cheek against his. No, not flirting. She snuggled up next to him as if she no longer needed to flirt with him because they were already close. As odd as it was, it made sense. She was a time walker. He had witnessed her death days just days before, and now, since she was not bound by time, here she was - a "past" version of herself alive after her own death. Maybe she had known him longer than he knew her.

  For an instant he felt the same familiarity as she had shown to her, as if he could lean into her too and it would just be normal. But then another thought crossed his mind. *Or I could slit your throat while your guard is down.* He immediately suppressed the thought as if she might hear. In reality, he could not kill her. He watched her die so he knew for a fact she would not die right now. But he might. Given her superior combat ability and the fact that his time of death was unknown he knew the risk was unwarranted. 

  He almost jumped when he felt her hand on his, holding it as if it were part of the sai and pushing it closer to the whip. She turned his hand so that the same edges were facing eacha other and pressed them close. "There are gashes missing," he said excitedly. She hummed in the affirmative and then fell silent, turning the object in his hand with an air of anticipation. "The gashes are larger on yours!" He screamed in amazement. She said nothing, but grinned an all knowing grin. "That doesn't make any sense. I tore this piece from your whip and made it into a sai. And then..." he trailed off in confusion, looking away and confused.

  "And then you forged this weapon, practiced with your friends, and fought me a handful of times."

  He continued in utter disbelief. "And I have not sharpened it. So my blade is further in [its own subjective time][]. It should be more worn... But it isn't. So my blade is from the past?"

[its own subjective time] #When this line is said in her timeline she is happy that he understands the blade has its own time, rather than it being Avas time.

  He looked at her utterly confused, lost in paradox. She [grinned back][] with the patience and joy of a teacher watching a student about to get it. Finally she let in, saving him from his own confusion. "The blades don't have to move in time with us. Sure we drag them around, but some they can move backwards as we move forward, or any which way."

[grinned back] # From his perspective there should only be descriptions of her appearance and insight into his thoughts. Vice versa when the chapter is told from her perspective.

<!-- I'm getting side tracked from what I was going to write so I'm going to summarize. Some of this can be in his timeline or hers or both or maybe in other chapters. Probably here, but different stories in each time line.

  She tells a story of an expiriment where she tied a blade to the roof by a rope and then set the rope on fire. She ran down and found a dark spot made of the blades material in the rock. When the blade fell, there was a cut in the rock but the black spot was gone and the blade sharper. When he asks why didn't she do it again and try to catch it, she said she did, but almost cut her hand open. She was too afraid to try again.

  She also pulls up a programming interface and makes a demonstation of him of a pad of paper with a stick figure drawing. The stick figure is animated in a 2d world. The then shows a rod (paperclip), bent and curving in 3 dimensions, jammed through the paper. On some frames there are one or three or five of the rod as it passes through the paper, but only one stick figure. -->

  "It's amazing really." She said, curling closer to him, eyeing his sai and pressing her weight onto his. "Don't ya think? Seeing the same object at the same time, in two different times?"

  A dark thought occurred to him and he asked, "Have you ever tried it?"

  "Hmmm?"

  "Finding yourself in the past... have you ever been tempted-"

  She moved away from him, again adopting a teachers tone. "I have... I had visions. I've had many visions where I go into trance." She grabbed his arm exitedly. "I see everything. All of space and time in four dimensions and I see... I see it all." An ominous breeze picked up as she breathed in deep and then died again when she exhaled. "I guess I never contacted myself because I never saw myself interracting with myself... until that day... but then one time I came close." She adopted a far off look, like a soldier recalling the horrors of war. "One night it occurred to me that I could find myself and tell myself... things. I don't even know what I'd say to my past self, but it occurred to me. That night I had a terrible dream. I had a headache. I didn't actually dream anything other than having a headache. And being sick, a terrible nausiousness that felt like dying. I woke and heard someting in the bushes. Or at least I think I did. It might have been part of the dream. The next morning I figured this was my chance. To explore my own past instead of the past of the world. To be a part of my own journey. So I walked backwards and found the same spot. It wasn't easy. You know how big the world becomes when you walk in time." He did not know, but he also did not feel that it was worth interrupting her to say so.

  "So I went back to that same spot. And as I came close to where I slept I became sick. All I remember is collapsing and vommitting. I woke while it was still dark, and in a terrible haze I ran as far away from myself as I could get." He tried to imagine what she felt, but was too afraid. *What would I even say to myself* He thought. *Could I say anything? Would I just lose it?*

  They sat in silence, [trying to erase the conversation][] in the night air. "We're not meant to interract with ourselves. Freedom in time is not that free." Her posture changed again, now pleading as much as explaining. "And that's what they fear in us. The computers. That's what we have that they don't. For the longest time they didn't know how to send information back in time. It turns out humans do this constantly, experiencing the future as much as remembering the past. I guess that's why I got sick when I tried to visit myself. Quantum phenomena only exisiting in the absense of observation. But there can be one observer." And inbetween the lines he finally read what she had been saying all along. If a particle moves back in time and interracts with itself quantum collapse occurs. He felt like he was the first man to see into a forbidden abyss.

[trying to erase the conversation] # When she experiences this she debates telling him about going back and fighting herself.

<!-- he realizes she may not know of her own death. He decides not to tell her but instead try to rescue by taking her far away from here and now -->
