* Need a filler adventure here
* Final trip to Terra
** Radio transmissions from humans on the surface prove that they survived
** Melissa comes out of her icy coma upon hearing the news
** Melissa cries over the death of Catherine
* Mars redux - Basement Purge and Melissa slays a Jaberwocky
* Drop the zombies off at Venus
* Back to sol
** In prior chapters I need to set up two characters:
*** "Javert" - A authority character from Mars, pursuing them after they escape from the basement
    - It is important that he does not see them drop the zombies off as they slingshot around venus
    - His ship is much larger and slower so he arrives much later to the Sol
*** "Viscious" - Child of the damned, mental clone of Io
    - Intends to use Sol I to destroy remains of humanity
    - Possibly the one who they rescue Cat from
    - Convinced he can not die (has been space frozen and thawed twice)
* Durga crashes into the sun
** Melissa turns into a time walker as she dies
** Of the skeleton crew on the ship, only the captain survives
** Javert assists with nukes in helping the platform descend (thinking he is destroying it)
** Returns with captain to Mars
