After Earth
========

<!-- after earth is destroyed the crew is sad. Durga tries to cheer them up. Her speach fails to rouse the crew so the gamer takes over -->

   $<!-- ... --> We will beat this.$ Durga insisted passionately. $Mankind may look dead but like a phoenix we will rise from our ashes and rise up as strong as ever.$ An awkward silence followed.

  `It was a good speach, but it's kind of cold coming from a over a speaker,` The Gamer said to her by SMS, secretly twitching his right hand to send out each letter. 

  `Yes,` Durga whispered back in his ear. `I think it may have had more punch coming from Melissa. Care to give it a try?` The Gamer nodded solemnly and then rose to speak. His voice was calm and steady and did not betray that he was just repeating the words she was saying only to him.

  "You're wrong," The Gamer said proudly. Only Jet turned to him; the rest of the crew still looked hopelessly at the floor. "We're not a phoenix because we aren't actually dead. In the oceans of earth there is a creature known as the immortal jelly fish. Rather than succumbing to old age the revert back to a larval state. Right now, in the hell that earth has become, they are probably waiting in their larval state, for the earth to heal so that they can return to adulthood. As far as we know they live forever. And that's what mankind is now. We're not defeated. We're back where we started: several disparate tribes, spread accross Sola, fighting against nature just to make it." He paused and looked to the nearest monitor. "Durga," the console chimed in response, "how many people are on mars?"

  "Last count was seventy four thousand."

  "Seventy four thousand," he continued, almost cutting her off with her own words. "Man started out with less and with less technology. We're not done yet. And unlike the larval immortals we retain all our memories of ten thousand years of civilization. It's not going to be easy, and just like our ancestors a bad joke by the Gods could wipe us out at any minute. But we will survive. We will grow again to adulthood." By now the mood of the room had shifted. Everyone looked to The Gamer, still crushed but a bit more hopeful. We can survive this. We must survive this. And we will. And in one hundred years, when the damage on earth has calmed down, the immortals will return to adulthood like nothing happened. They will rise up to the surface and they will see civilization regrown on the surface. They won't remember us, but we will remember them."

  "But first, we have a long road ahead of us. We have to fix this. You, and I and everyone on this ship is humanities best hope. First we repair this ship, then we fix Mars. And Luna. And maybe even Venus. But first this ship."

<!-- everyone goes back to work. Later Jet approaches The Gamer with a problem with waste recycling. The Gamer reminds Jet that he previously called The Gamer a worthless slacker. Jet says that Melissa (er... Durga) brought the gamer onboard because you can load him up with miscelaneous drugs and get solutions to impossible problems. "But I haven't even had my morning Ayuhuasca yet!" The Gamer jokes and then looks over the problem. He says they can repurpose the sanitization tank to replace the broken part since their new physiology doesn't have trouble with the diseases of old. -->
