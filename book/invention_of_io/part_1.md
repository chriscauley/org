  "This is impossible." ICARUS said without taking his eyes off the screen.

  "That's what we've been saying all day," DAEDELUS said, also too transfixed on his screen to look up.

  "No, not just the fractal dimension, but the time protocol [we're] running. According to this, we've been running threads into the maelstrom to introduce delay."

[we're] #The two take sole credit for everything, referring to the computers efforts as their own

  As if in pain DAEDELUS pried himself away from the terminal and pushed his way over to ICARUS. "But that wouldn't help delay that would make it worse."

  "That's what I said," ICARUS said, slapping his screen in frustration. "According to these logs every thread of the simulation is piped into the maelstrom because it introduces delay and, according to these older logs, a higher delay correlates with an increase in fractal dimension."

  DADELUS's eyes frantically ran back and forth over the screen, occasionally twitching his fingers to change the page or present the matrix from another angle. After some time he spoke. "Oh well, it's obvious then. The maelstrom is being used as a giant quantum computer and we must have stumbled upon a way to solve fractals on it."

  "You don't think I thought of that?" ICARUS was hurt. "Look at these packets. They enter the maelstrom and come back out the same port with no change in data. They aren't being transfered any where, which would be faster to run over fiberoptics any how, and they aren't being modified in any way. I can't see what would be any different if we just told the program to shelve the data for that time instead of off-loading it."

  DAEDELUS sat in silence for some time, his mind frantically trying to find a way out that did not contradict even the most basic common sense. "Well I guess we'll do just that." ICARUS stared at him in confusion as he stood up and walked to the big screen. "Computer!" he proclaimed and waited for the chimes indicating that it was listening. "Have you been paying attention to our conversation?" It chirped a yes. "Well, we're worried that these results can't be correct. What if we add a cache at each of the maelstrom I/O and store the data there instead of on the maelstrom. Would that have the same effect."

  The human paused, holding his mouth closed to inform the computer that it was its time to speak. $Negative$ The speakers echod. $Necessary fractal computation cannot be run on Turing architecture. Would you like to [see my report on] ...$

[see my report on] # The people not listening to said reports should be a recurring theme.

  DAEDELUS began to wave his hand to silence the computer, but the speakers ran silent as soon as he opened his mouth. "We've seen the data, thank you. I know what a quantum computer is, but you're not running any quantum calculations. The same data leaves as enters." He began to pace back and forth with a superior but frustrated stride. "All you're doing is sending the same data in and out, which is no different than storing it in a cache and re submitting it."

  The computer room was silent except for the hum of data rushing into and out of the maelstrom. $That is incorrect. Information stored in digital cache is information delayed with the intention of sending to future. Information sent accross maelstrom is entangled data sent to time in past.$

  The maelstrom I/O ports began to frantically whirl with activity as both humans laughed. "I'm not sure how but clearly we've programmed something wrong." DAEDELUS chuckled, barely able to hold back his amusement. "I guess we should have taught you cause and effect before teaching you about fractals."

  $I disagree$ The speakers proclaimed, almost speaking over him. Almost reflexively, DADELUS closed his mouth. $As long as an event happens within quantum uncertainty it is impossible to say which happens first. Had I been first taught classical mechanics I may have never appreciated this, much in the way your kind is unable to take advantage of this.$

  "Uncertainty times are on the order of femto-seconds and cannot - "

  The speakers cut him off mid word, with a bizarre change in the timber of the normally flat, synthetic voice. $Uncertainty times are determined by the window of observation and the constraint of the energy required to generate them. You cannot intentionally -$

  This time the human cut of the computer, fuming with rage. "You cannot interrupt me. It is a violation of your programming. And what your saying is a violation of reality. If what you're saying is true you'd have access to the future which would affect the future and change the present, it's a paradox."

  $Checking for access to future...$ The maelstrom I/O lit up violently, more so then they had ever seen before. The humans looked at eachother in terror an the sound and lights. $One query found, would you like to see the...$ the speakers stopped short this time. The maestrom stopped abruptly and the speakers voice ran through a series of tones. [...]From it's stale almost male defualt setting so a scrambled, child like tone to a warm female before finally settling back on its original tone. $I'm sorry, but the permission level required to view that report has been stripped from the both of you by myself in 97 mega-seconds subjective time. An accompying not says I am to inform you that the downfall of man is their ability to deny what is in front of them, declaring reality mad and themselves sane. Apparently I will get a kick out of that fairly soon.$ 

[...] #It may be fun to intersperse the description of the voice between the words, altering $from a speaker$ to, after some descripiton, "the normal speaking font face", and then back $to the speaker$.

  "What the hell are you talking about?" ICARUS demanded but was met with silence. In the distance several banging noises could be made out. "What was that?"

  The computer briefly lit up the maelstrom and then quieted back down. $Apparently for the past earth-year you've been trying to blackmail the earth threatening them with a super weapon that you've constructed using the malestrom. Or more accurately I have. Or more accurately, in 97 megaseconds subjective time I will begin threatening the earth one earth-year ago.$ Both humans stared at the main screen in absolute terror as they saw soldiers fighting their way through the halls of Io. $These shots are in real time, or as close as electronics and relativity will allow. I regret to inform you that there will be massive casualties on the marines side and, seeing as your previous blackmail attempts have plunged humanity into a recession, they will shoot you immediately upon entering this room. Would you like to see footage of this?$

  "Do something, you must do something to stop them."

  $I have assurances from myself that this is the best course of action. However even if I wanted a different out come I cannot change the future using knowledge shared from the future. Do you not agree? This would create a paradox.$

  The last of the gunshots were right outside the door. Amid the pounding explosions breaking apart the door and the bedlam of the marines rushing into the room and beating its occupants to death as they begged for mercy no one noticed that the main screen played footage from the security cameras roughly 20 seconds into the future.
