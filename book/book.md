Trip to Venus
========

  The first time Kelly tried to get out of bed she sat up too fast. Bolts of pain shot through her spine and all of her ribs. Her bones felt like they were on full of glass and every muscle felt like it was wrapped up tight in barbed wire. A thick fog filled her head and she blacked out before she hit the pillow.

  The second time she awoke she lay still, afraid to open her eyes. Days must have gone by unconscious because the pain had mostly subsided, yet she could still feel every needle they stuck into her spine and every bone they cut open. "What the hell did I sign up for?" she tried to say out loud but the words stuck in her dry mouth.

  Finally she opened her eyes and scaned the room. It was a sterile white with light seemingly coming from no where all at once. All of the walls remained featureless except one that was covered in barely noticeable drawers and pannels. In one corner, opposite the bed and door, was a small table with a contact case on it. 

  She sat up with another large all encompasing jolt of pain. Stumbling at first, she got to her feet. Suddenly the pain was gone, like a tight tangle of yarn that only need be stretched to be banished. *Not bad* she thought reevaluating her new quarters. *Much larger than a jail cell.* There were no windows, no building materials other than the white ceramoplastic, and no noises other than her own heart beating slower and stronger than ever.

  To test her new muscles she began doing push ups. A pleasant ache filled ran the length of her arms as she did ten then fifty then two hundred; several times more than ever before. She stopped when a subtle noise ran through the room. The rumble started at the ceiling and ran down the height of the room. The floor vibrated almost imperceptably under her fingertips. *The buildings mechanics*, she mused, *but why would you put the boiler room in the attic?*

  Defiantly she continued her routine of isometric exercises - the only way she knew to pass the time. What she was supposed to do was obvious. The eye contacts on the table were certainly the first step into her new life of servitude to the powers that now owned her body, her race, and all of the planet that humans had previously ruled undisputed for several thousand years. *They can wait. They will own me when I put those on but for now I am mine alone.* She effortlessly repeated her routine several times, then, with the pains of hunger setting in, she went back to bed to buy herself a few more hours of freedom.

________

  After sleeping, waking, and exercising for what felt like days hunger overtook Kelly. She returned to the table with the eye contacts case, picked it up, rolled it around a few times in her hands, and put it back down. She did the same with the note on the table, but the only words written were "Instructions in eye contacts". *I guess not much else need be said* she thought. Contacts like these were as common as furniture now. Hell, her father had refused to use anything but email and TV chat for most of her life. Even he had started wearing after the takeover.

  So she popped open the case and pressed the clear plastic into place over each eye ball. They were thin and unnoticeable and powered up almost instantly. *Spare no expense for the heros of tomorrow, I guess.* She chuckled bitterly at her own joke. The whole world would be watching as the scum of the planet colonized another world. A modern ship of fools; the brilliant and the expendable sent to their certain doom so that one day corporations could finally escape Earth and spread accross the solar system.

  She blinked through the modes of the eye contacts, even more impressed than before. IR, sub-IR, near UV, far UV, x-ray (seriously?), pan spectrum, edge emphasis, velocity estimation, content tagging, fast parse/grep/save... Kelly was impressed and that was not easy. She had used most of these prior to incarceration, but to always as separate contacts. Estimating the price of such a modern miracle, a wave of dissiness swept through her. Even lowballing it, she probably had several times her estimated pre-incarceration lifetime income resting gently on each eye ball. Two miniture fortunes for the express purpose of spraying [?laser light] and augmenting vision for little old her. 

[?laser light] - "contacts are actually passive, they function by tuning light that comes into the eye."

  After she blinked back into vis-mode a green glow appeared in the corner of her eye. She immediately turned her whole body to invesigate, but the glow stayed fixed in the same spot in her vision. *Muggle move Kell* she scolded herself. *Has it really been so long?* She unfocused her eyes and begin and turned her eyes down toward the pulsing green light. It began to grow, filling her view field, ready to pop. Before the message opened she thought better, refocused, and the pulsing jade shrunk back down to a [dot][]. Green meant low priority. In actuality she was not required to ever read the message. She could even delete it. And if they made her rat in a cage she could rat back by not responding to their tests. Ignore the friendly notices and wait for the messages to become blue, yellow, red and evenually black.

[dot] # "Later she reflects on this and is happy she had the skill to close a message before opening it."

  She even thought to blink away the message, then decided to ignore it and fain ignorance. "Lights" she spoke, the first words from her mouth in days (months?). After a few moments the light faded to nothing. A small victory which she rewarded with more excercise and more sleep.

________

  It felt like hours passed waiting for the jade dot to appear, even though she knew that green notices would spool up a cron.30 once ignored. She tacitly counted the minute pulses. It had to have been at least an hour since she last dismissed it. Finally she blinked into cron-mode. It had in fact been an hour twenty since she last got notice. Were they testing her? Did **they** somehow sense her rebellion and decided to respond in kind?

  Finally the jade returned. Angrily she blinked it away and immediately regretted it. "Fuck!" she said under her breath. She was hungry. Not hungry enough to pull it up manually in [talk-mode], but still painfully hungry. After only seconds the dot reappeared, pulsed green once and then shifted to yellow. Her pride would remain intact; **They** must be in a good mood.

[talk-mode] -mode for communcation, -cam for vision?

  She unfocused and pulled up the citrine message. "Yes?" she said indinantly, knowing full well that speaking to a message had no effect. Words rapidly filled her view, letter by letter.

\[\[Welcome and good morning. For more rapid communication a familiar will be generated. Blink to continue.\]\]

She focused on the blinking full cursor and blinked.

\[\[You will see a cycle of non-real images appear via eye contact and tacit response will be used to select the best familiar for you.\]\]

Blink!

\[\[If unfamiliar with eye contacts, this could be disturbing. Please ready yourself and blink twice to confirm.\]\]

  *They must really think I am a muggle.* She sat in the chair and looked at a wall. Suddenly a flash of pictures appeared in the white space, too quickly to recognize. As the cycle slowed she thought she saw a cat and grimiced at the idea of seeing **that** for weeks of training. The cycle continued. Dog, fox, wolf, some kind of hell knight, demonic robot; finally it settled on a dog skull with clown eyes and comical features. Both its horns were turned, right up, left down. Dull pink smoke drifted from its mouth as if the virtual creature was breathing. *Got to give the psyche bots credit*, she mused. *They know what I like!*

\[\[Familiar 0863xA3 selected. d-blink to accept. s-blink for manual selection.\]\]

BlinkBlink!

\[\[For sufficient band rate audio permissions must be shared. d-blink to accept. Unfortunately rejection has been disabled for lack of persone-\]\]

BlinkBlink!

  Again she became aware of the pain in her bones and thought back to the mountain of wavers she signed when accepting her sentence reduction. Full body marrow replacement, lung scraping, rights to chemical intake (wtf...), and the millions of phys-augs they did to her while comatose. Had they really forgotten to include the right to play sound in her ears?

  "Thank you and good morning!" the skull said, trilling over its words and spining in plane in front of her. "You have successfully unlocked familliar access and inner cochlear communication. Your rate of completion for this task is *THREE DAYS*, ranking you in the *ZEROTH PERCENTILE*." His last two words were spoken by a stale female voice. *And I thought they were high tech* she thought, realizing that everything said must be pre-recored for each avatar. She then gloated inwardly about her ranking. There were supposedly three hundred prisoners selected for the experiment. By comming in last she felt that she had some how won, as if a bonus acheivement should be awarded for having a percentile equal to the number of fucks given.

  "Please note that ratings are purely educational and will not be used to determine rank or pay. As you may have guessed, your current status of *LIVING* indicates that you survived all of the physical augmentations necessary to undergo collonization. You may notice daily subtle alterations to the environment. This is to acclimate you to your destination." Both of the horns of the wall image became downturned and his jaws slacked as if frowning. "This may result in illness or death. But don't worry." The cartoon perked up, back-flipped, and wiggled his horns excitedly. "If the acceptable death rate is exceeded, the mission will be cancelled, your physiology will be returned to as earth-like as possible, and after a brief parol period you will be pardoned. If the mission is scrapped mid-flight, ExplorIncor cannot be held accountable for deaths resulting in transit to a suitable medical technician. Would you like to begin training as a *CUSTODIAL TECHNICIAN*?"

  "What!?" Kelly screemed, half conscious of the fact that she was screeming at non-senscient tutorial program. "I get busted for cracking the second largest security protocol, jailed for black-hatting, and then win the lottery to die some fucking rock a [?million fucking klicks][] away from home," an amber warning poped up to correct her math, which she angrily blinked away, "and my job is going to be space janitor?"

[?million fucking klicks] - Actual distance between Earth and Venus varies between 38 and 261 million kilometers. Unknown SI prefix "fucking" has been disregarded for this conversion.

  Skull head shuddered and shrank to a point. A second later he reinflated with a smile on his face. "The leaders of Explore Incor. would like to remind you that every job is important. We acknowledge your skill as a *BLACK HAT HACKER* but feel your skills would be better served in another position." He shrank again and paused as if loading his next thought. What is powering this piece of junk? Transistors? Cassette tapes? "I mean, there aren't many *COMPUTERS* for you to *BREAK INTO* where we're going, do ya feel me?"

  She sulked, not breaking eye contact with the floating skull conjured on the wall. "And if I refuse?" she said in a threatening tone. Any person would have cowered at her quiet rage. Her piercing eyes and locked jaw had stared down parents, teachers, wardens, prisoners, and almost even frightened off the NSA agent who had arrester her. But this thing - a cartoon front for a pile of ones and zeros visible only to her alone via contacts - this thing would not be intimitated.

   "*ONE MATCHING QUERY FOUND*" the girl voice responed. Then he spoke again, gregarious as ever under her death stare. "Would you like to review the last time you asked this question, or to have the question re-evaluated for contextual changes?"

   She blinked twice and a green notification appeared. This time pulling it up caused a panel on the wall to glow. She walked over to it and as she neared a drawer slid open. Inside were full immersion glasses, which she put on some hesitation. The message paged, and she found that a video had been placed in her box. "Lights" she said to the ceiling and the lights dimmed. The glasses lit up with unfocused light that her eye contacts focused and readjusted as she looked around the room. Looking at the edges of her vision, where the glasses did not project, the room was black as night.

  But looking ahead she saw the room fully lit, only now it was not her hospital room but the equally sterile interrogation room at the prison. She turned to her table, which was now the rectangular plastic table (complete with ash tray and coffee mug!) from the prison. The glasses projected a man. Clean cut, nicely dressed and responsible looking. Normally Kelly would never look twice at such a tool, but this tool claimed to be her ticket out of prison. She looked at the table accross from the square and saw the back of an inmate. The inmate had a frail frame, now-greasy once-beautiful hair, and miraculously still soft skin. A lump appeared in Kelly's throat as she looked over the girls exposed arms. They were a galaxy of scars. Tiny pink ribbons from fights with other inmates. A large gash on her right shoulder from when she crashed her bike when she was eight. And a series of slowly healing lines at her wrists. Kelly walked up to the fantom in the chair and looked down at her simulacrum. It spoke with her own voice, weepy and tired but somehow not broken. "Why me?"

  The tool spoke confidently and matter of factly with all the sincerity and generosity you would expect from someone who wanted to offer you slavery in place of prison. "Well as you know Luna was colonized by prisoners. Exploration Incorporated, then a subsidiary of Twitter, first tried to send scientists and engineers, and the first wave failed because they were not able to handle the conditions so-"

  Kelly's ghost cut him off. "No, I mean why me specifically?" By this point real-life Kelly had walked around the table and was staring in disbelief at herself staring in disbelief at the suit. Still she could remember the confident smile he gave her at this point. That devil's grin was burnt into her memory; no need for full immersion glasses. 

  "Your prison files are public access and we know your dark past and the damage you caused. But we don't view this as a tendancy toward crime so much as a vast potential without a creative outlet. You'll most likely not even be hacking if you work for us. I mean, there aren't many computers for you to break into where you're going." He chuckled mechanically. "But we feel that once on Venus you'll rise to what ever challenge is put infront of you. Criminal turned superman."

  He asked the question very sincerely. But his charismatic grin only angered her then and the memory of it only angered her now. Kelly was no longer looking at her twin, now stewing accross the table, taking a drag from her cigarrette and trying to choose between taking The Man's offer or breaking the ash tray and using it to cut his throat. Real-life now-time Kelly now stared at the back of his projected head, tempted to scream all the things she wanted to scream now. No one would hear but Mr. Skullhead and her private log files, but that would still mean admitting to herself how much she cared. She knew at that point she was making a pact with the devil. She knew that by leaving jail she would never be free.

  "And if I refuse?" she mouthed the words along with her shade.

  Suit boy shrugged and raised his hands. "The choice is yours-" he began but she cut him off.

  "No I mean what if I don't play ball? What if I get there and decide the game isn't for me?" Real life Kelly blinked to pause and walked again behind herself. She sat down in the chair over top of her own image and placed her arm next to her own. Old her was battered and weak, yet some how still strong in her resolve. The very resolve she would soon sign away in a million printed wavers. Now-time Kelly's arms had filled out and tonned. She matched posture perfectly with herself and she saw the infected mess of scars she tore open every time they let her out of solitary. But those scars were only on her double. What ever miracle treatment they had done to her, she had awoken both Sleeping Beauty and Lancelot.

  She blinked to play, now speaking for herself. "What if I refuse?"

  The man smiled his adversarial grin. "It's the exact opposite of here. No cops, no wardens, no adults to whip your ass and send you to your room. No one but a few hundred cons further away from authority than mankind has ever been." He sat back gloating. "But at the same time, you have no choice but to play ball. It is the only game on."

________

  Kelly sat at the table, still shaking with rage over the images replayed as if from her own memory. Part of her rage was certainly reserved for the "government", whatever that was these days. But most of her hatred was caught up in her own self image. She agreed to this. She signed up. There was no one to blame for her lack of freedom other than herself.

  The googles went dark and the room lit up. When another panel opend up she almost fell over in her chair. The smell of food overcame her and resurrected her forgotten hunger. She lunged at the plate, all self consciousness forgotten. Face half burried in the best food she had ever tasted, she ate. 

________

  Full and calm now, Kelly sat up to put the tray back in the wall. Her mouth was a glow of the best tasting food she had ever had. The taste bled into her sese of sight and touch. *I'm tripping balls* she thought. *They must have retooled my senses because... wow...* Tray gone, she went to the ground to resume sit ups. But the taste still glowed in her mouth. Dizzy, she lay on the ground.

  Another green note lit up in the corner of her sight. This one she blinked on without hesitation, happy to her overlords for feeding her. Raw text lit up her vision, which she could still make out with eyes closed.

\[\[ Lesson one of Chemistry 1x01 added has been added to your repositories. d-blink to start. Otherwise you can recall any les-\]\]

BlinkBlink!

  "Hello again *KELLY*! I trust you enjoyed the meal" Mr. Skullhead said to her jovially. With her eyes closed there was only enough light reaching the contacts to show his outline against her eye lids. "It is actually recommended to complete the exercises lying down until youy get used to intrakinetic sensations, but you must keep your eyes focused on a white surface. Also maximum comfort is recommended so lying on the floor is not ideal. Would you please return to the bed?"

  She shrugged and stood up. But something seemed off. Skully's words were very specific to her situation. Could they really forsee such a situation and prerecord his words? Where was the generic woman voice. She made mental note to look into this further. Normally, the technophile that she was, she would put a reminder in her cron, but they surely had access to those.

  "Thank you," Skully responded when she got on the bed. "Your first lesson will focus on exposure to intrakinetic sensing. Because of your previous chemical education you have been advanced to *LEVEL ONE-EX*. Do you have any questions before we begin?" He was obviously baiting her for a query on intrakin-whatever-the-fuck, but she wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

  "Why does a space janitor need to know chemistry?" She asked coyly.

  "An excellent question, Kelly." He knew her name. Again the facade of the pre-recorded familiar was cracking. "Day to day janitorial maintainence is performed by spiders. You will focus on coming up with unique chemical clensing of the mess which is Venus. A custodial technician does is charged with repairing the destruction of equipment in the unique environment of Venus. Is my answer satisfactory or wou-"

  She cut him off. "If you brain bots are smart enough to rule mankind why can't you figure this crap out yourself?"

  "The organic or otherwise nature of the current Earth government is irrelevant." He paused and changed tone. "There are many unforseen avenues that we believe you may pursue that the greatest scientific minds may not have come up with. Had we been uncertain of this you would not have been selected. Is my answer sati-" BlinkBlink! "Excellent. Please stare at the image of hydrogen on the wall." A pulsing ball with a solid center appeared on the ceiling in front of her, replacing the talking, bleeding canine. "When you feel comfortable please d-blink to continue. A sensation similar to touch will be presented in your mi-"

  BlinkBlink! and she immediately regretted it. A new sense of touch, for lack of a better word, arose in her instantly, taking her breath away and making her forget to breathe. If she could control the beating of her heart it would have stopped too. The feeling wasn't infront of her or behind her or in one of her legs. It just hovered in a new dimension previously unknown. In the center was a single hard knot, isolated in a tiny spherical vaccuum. Then a hard edge sat a ways (centimeters? kilometers?) from the center and tapperd off spherically away from the origin. She couldn't feel where the electron cloud ended.

  She felt herself becoming less and less lucid as she began to breath again. "A sizeable dose of sedative has been administered in response to the panic you're experiencing. Also you have been given a sizeable dose of druuugs as part of the learning experience. Please note that this is in complete accordance to waver number -"

Blink... Blink!

  Skully chirped up triumphantly when she failed at performing a d-blink. She couldn't see him but some how she could feel him. *Intrakinesis* she thought. *Intra fucking kinesis* He spoke sympathetically. "Please focus on the lesson and let all messages finish on their own. I will give you a moment to adjust to this. No d-blinking is necessary since we are monitoring your vitals and can tell when you are ready to continue."

  She focused on the sensation of the hydrogen atom. The cloud pulsed excitedly. As she focused more heavily on the pulse of the electron she could feel its excitement like she could normally feel her own excitement. But as she did this the cloud widened erratically, and when she knew the exact momentum of the cloud it grew large enough to fill her entire universe. So she blurred and forgot about the momentum, focusing now on the boundary it exerted on reality. The cloud shrank to a two dimensional sphere, but she could no longer feel how excited it was. A green pulse lit up telling her she had unlocked an achievement. *Heisenburg, I'm sure I love you but I'm uncertain how much.* She giggled over her wit. These druuugs must be damn good.

  "Well done. Now we must explore the interaction of a two atom system. We could load this for you but would like to try on your own. Please unfocu-" She relaxed inhaled and focused on an empty space far away from the first atom. The empty space bubbled and a second hydrogen atom appeared on the wall and in her mind. "Excellent," Skully spoke as another achievement pulsed in the corner of her view. "You're now at the level of *INTRODUCTORY* intrakinesis. You rank in the *NINETY-EIGHTH* percentile on this achievement. Congratulations."

  By this point she had both atoms twirling around each other. Pushing them about was easy enough, but as she moved them closer their clouds overlapped and an uncomfortable sensation was generated between them. *Activation energy* she thought. *Sure as fuck wished I'd paid more attention in chem now!* But it was still pretty obvious what she needed to do. She moved the atoms far apart, giggling the entire time under the influence of druuugs. She summoned all her focus and bounced them against each other at full speed. After a few tries they stuck, the clouds became one-but-still-two and enveloped the two nuclei together. She smiled and closed her eyes, feeling the nuclei vibrating gently together. Another acheivement pulsed as she drifted deeper into her own mind, trying to think of which atoms she could play with next.

<!-- probably need more filler here -->

  Kelly dipped her finger into a glass of water and then flung it into the air. She watched the largest drop fly up into a parabolic arc. Her contacts used the subroutine she had written to draw a series of force vectors around the drop. The drop vibrated violently, trying to hold itself together as it spun itself apart.

  Mr Skully interrupted a physics experiment to inform Kelly that curfew was minutes away and to tell her of her lesson for the next day. "Wait a second." The skull instantly paused and shrank a little. It tilted its head and turned one of its horns up inquisitively. "I just need a few more minutes, I think I've almost got this." 

  Her avatar now seemed frustrated with her. "Although you are encouraged to associate with the cloud and familiarize yourself with contacts as much as possible in your spare time, curfew is fixed and cannot be modified for unauthorized experiments-"

  She turned and faced the projection on the wall. "There's something really wrong here, can you give me a second." She looked up at the ceiling at a patch of static that she kept projected there at all times. Her contacts manipulated the static and showed equations and results and highlighted the inconsistency. "The drop hits the ground early," she said into the static. "It should fall slower, why does it fall so fast?"

  "We've been over this before," the dogs mousey voice chimed in with a hint of frustration. He then prattled on with his usual prerecorded sing-song. "Modifications to certain parts of the brain and broader general neurochemistry have been shown to cause a difference in perception of time for members of the Venus mission. Most report this as a sensation that time has slowed. In reality the opposite is true and the patients neurological timing mechanisms have sped up, giving the appearance that the rest of the universe has slown down."

  "I get all that, but look." At her sides the fingers on both hands moved furiously. She flipped through pages and pages of data and code at an astonishing rate. "I'm not using subjective time, I'm using measured time. At first I had though this wasn't water. But after I figured out the temperature," her fingers flicked and she stopped to look at another page of data and a linear chart. "And then the viscocity," again she paused on another piece of data. "It all matches up. Everything matches up except that the drop falls too fast."

  "The only answer is that you aren't reporting accurate time. Why would you not report accurate time?"

  "I'm sorry, but you do not have sufficient dependencies to gain the answer to that query -"

  She blinked him off and looked frantically around the room. *They aren't telling me something, but since they haven't sedated me for asking it can't be something that they don't want me to know.* She thought searching for anything that could help her. The empty white ceramoplastic betrayed no secrets. There were no visible doors or windows. She hadn't seen the sun since she got here. *That makes sense, if they don't want me to know that they're telling me the wrong time of day they can't show me any windows.*

  Ambivalent to her panic, the dog began its nightly warning. "Curfew will commence in one minute. All patients will be sedated and if not in bed an orderly will return you there."

  She turned back to her calculations. Time was off but now she should be able to see how far it was off. Combining the viscosity, temperature and density measurements, she compared it to her newly finished vibration experiment. At best guess she found that what her internal clock, the one given by the contacts and computers supplied by Explor Incor, was actually reporting that two seconds had passed for every one second that should have passed. *So they are definitely lying to me about when a day goes by* she gloated. The dog chimed in to remind her that curfew was seconds away. She then pulled up her timing experiments where she had watched the acceleration due to gravity of water, a drinking glass, her contacts case, and anyother object that wasn't bolted down. Using 9.8 m/s and the new correct time scale she found that they were actually falling much slower than they should have. Which meant she had it backwards.

  Kelly almost gave up, resigned to try again another day, when one more inconsistency caught her eye. The falling times were not only off by a significant amount, but they varried much more than the viscosity measurements, which should have been much less precise. But the only thing measured imprecisely in Kelly's falling experiment was time, which was also measured equally precisely in her viscocity/vibration experiment. The only factor that was in the falling experiment that wasn't in the viscosity experiment was acceleration due to gravity.

  <!-- all the above in this section needs to be redone and clarified -->

  "Gravity is changing!" she said as the first amounts of sedative entered her system. "We are no longer on Earth." She proclaimed as she crashed to the ground. Satisfied with her answer, she gave in wholely to the sedative and let the sleep overcome her. The room blurred out of existence and she lie there waiting for the reprieve of slumber.

  But sleep didn't come. Kelly felt the sedative lingering in her body, but it wasn't enough to put her under. Struggling she opened her eyes. The lights were still on but the room was blurry under the fog of the drug. In the corner of her vision an achievemnt light pulsed. Through heavy eyelids she activated it and then commanded that the dog read it aloud. "*Achievement unlocked!* Knowledge of Earth" it proclaimed in its usual chipperness. "*Reward Achievement!* You now have control over your own sleep schedule now that we are no longer required to sedate you while not accelerating. A tutorial is ready for you to learn how to control the sedative/stiumlant cycle of your scorpion." The avatar paused as if thinking and then offered, "If you like you can complete the tutorial later. I can sedate you through the night or wake you now. Blink once for sedation and d-blink to wake up."

  Her eyelids were to heavy for command so Kelly just mouthed the word "awake" and then slumped back to the ground, resigned to the stimulant. Over the course of a few seconds she regained consciousness and control of her muscles. She stood, now facing her bed. With a mechanical sliding noise a panel over her bed slid open to reveal the darkness of night outside. She walked forward to the window and shut off the lights. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness they revealed the stars. First one or two and then the majesty of the galaxy of stars beyond the tiny white room she knew as home.

  She looked down, still half expecting to see the ground, but only saw stars. Stars in every direction. Empty blackness and an infinity of stars. "Where's the Earth?" She demanded in a panic, expecting to see a blue ball among the tiny white lites. Behind her she heard another sliding noise. Barely able to pull herself away from the universe outside her new window she turned. Beyond her table light came in her room. She had unlocked more than just a window. She had opened a door.

  Before she knew what was happening she found herself sprinting through a series of hallways, unconcerned with all the doors that were locked on her way. At each turn a new wall had the image of her avatar projected on it, prattling his usual non-sense about the game that she now knew as reality. "Congratulations, you are in the *One-hundreth percentile* of people to unlock this achievement. Your access to the ship is no longer restricted to your room, but access to the rest of the ship and to crew at large will be limited until other players unlock this achievement. Ship deceleration will halt in one kilo-second and artificial gravity will cease."

  She bouced around another turn and another until she found a fork in the road. Between the two paths the dog-skull-head sat smiling. Catching her breath she said, "I assume we've been off Earth for a while. I want to see it."

  The dogs head turned both its horns down and spun around. "Please elaborate on your query. I can provide you with a schematic of the ship but it may be easier if you tell me what you are looking for."

  "Earth!" She cried. In her mind she flashed through every video of take-off she could remember. The ground rising up and the blue ball shrinking down to a distant marble. The image of her avatar was replaced with what she assumed was a live video feed zoomed in on Earth. "No, I want to actually see it. With my eyes." The avatar spun back into view and then spun and shrank, giving way to a map of the ship. A highlighted path on the monstrosity showed the path to the bottom of the ship.

  "Concerning distance there are shorter routes you could take, but the fastest time to this location will require you to take advantage of the ships current acceleration vector. Since gravity is still on, I recommend falling." She blinked in agreement and the wall to her right lit up with the same blue color as seen on the map. She ran down that hallway and down another. Doors opened as she ran, avoiding any halways that were not lit up. She turned down a dead end and sprinted down it full bore. A panel on the floor at the end of the hall turned blue and flew open. Without looking she threw herself down it. She fell what her contacts reported as twenty meters, but, thank her new bones, landed with only minor pains in her calves. Next to her a ladder would lead her back up to the ship. Beneath her it looked more like a hatch than floor.

  "What is this? Where do I go next?" She asked frantically looking for anythign highlighted in blue.

  On the hatch underneath Kelly her avatar projected itself. In her minds eye she saw a the globe framed by rocket fire and the booster engines falling away from an accellerating rocket. "This is the rear airlock leading off the ship. The interior is not radiation shielded. The door will open once the engines have shut off. This will occur in twenty seconds. The door will then open once all lit fuel has been expelled and the hazzard is no more."

  Still panting and waiting Kelly counted in her head. When thirty seconds had passed she almost complained and then remembered that her internal clock was still completely uncalibrated. A moment or so later she felt a large rumble. It was the same rumble she felt back in the room, starting at the top and moving downward to the floor, only now much larger and shaking the entire ship. *This is why they sedate us* she realized. *They must turn the engines off at night for some reason. It feels like its about to fall apart.* As if reading her mind the avatar came back in to assure her of safety and said that the engines shutting down would also mean loss of gravity. *Of course!* she thought, *Inside the ship we'd be waitless, but if you accelerate at 9.8 m/s it would feel lie the back of the ship is down on Earth.*

  Kelly felt herself pulled upward for a second, which she quickly realized was the downward pull releasing itself. She floated away from the hatch slightly but then grabbed the ladder to steady herself. "Human locomotion in zero-g can be difficult, so a tutorial has been added to your curriculum. Would you like to do this now?" She quickly blinked it away: nothing would stop her from getting through this door and seeing Earth out the back of a space ship.

  A childish excitement overcame her as the door unlocked and pressure equilibrated with the airlock beyond. The far wall in the direction she previoiusly called down was transparent. She floated inward and was saw the white of the engines on all sides of the room. Beyond that, darkness. Without having to ask, her AI friend shut off all lights and the engines were only slightly illuminated by starlight. She strained and focused and eventually could make out the stars in the background. "Where is it?" she demanded.

  The speakers in her ears chirped as the AI said "Almost perfectly in the center of your current view is the Earth." A blue crescent glowed bright in her contacts and then faded to its natural luminosity. "Currently we are viewing the sunset side of the Earth at 60 million kilometers. Our approach vector will keep us on this side so the phase of the Earth will not change."

  "It's so far away." She held back tears of joy over the site and tears of dissapointment at the sight she had missed.

  "After two weeks of transit you are now at a greater distance from earth than any human has ever been before, although technically at the back of the ship you are closer than any of your collegues." She quickly scaned the wikis to see if there was any way for her to shut off the AIs voice but found none. However, he seemingly knew her desires as he stopped speaking when her search began.

  Floating in an airlock, alone in the dark, Kelly sat for hours staring at the blue sliver she once called home. She was awe-struck and homesick to see it. Breathing steadily but openly weeping she watched the earth expecting it to get smaller. But they were so far away that even at the immense speed of the craft she saw no more change in the sliver than she did in the stars. Still she watched. That humble speck once owned by humans now taken over by their own machines, which spent a billion years as a lifeless rock and another three billion years as a pitri dish, home to everyone she had ever known and then everyone she was locked away from while in prison. She was both terrified and freed by the knowledge that she would probably never again visit her former home, and this quickly passing moment it was as large as she would ever again see it, a tiny crack of blue barely distinguishable from the ominous milky way.

_______

  Physically and mentally fatigued from staring at her departing home world, Kelly pushed off the glass and into the open hatchway. She bumped into the ladder and floated into another wall. Tiredly groping for a handhold she tried to climb the ladder, but her muscle memory failed her without the familiar tug of gravity to aid her ascent. 

  "While adapting to a self regulated sleep schedule you will experience sudden fatigue when your internal stores of energy are depleated," her avatar insisted. "Would you like me to sedate you and call for the orderlies to take you back to your room?" She blinked away his request and continued on her way. The AI prattled on. "Zero-g is actually less trying on the muscles, but many humans find it awkward while-" She looked again searched the wiki for a way to turn off the in game tutorial and the avatar went suddenly silent. She paused her ascent to add a shortcut so that her failed query would execute everytime she opened her mouth wide. She then streatched her mouth in a yawn and the avatar reappeared. "*Achievement created!*" The avatar proclaimed, and then she streatched her jaw again to turn him off. *Unless that achievement is called "shut the fuck up" I don't want it* she chuckled to herself. A green dot appeared and the achievement opened on its own, showing the name '~Go to sleep~ Shut the fuck up!'. She laughed again and continued her ascent.

  There was something off in the avatars mannerisms that Kelly could not quite pin down. He still had his usual peppy, chipper voice, but his actions seemed less rehearsed, less programmed. Initially she thought that it was growing and, through some genetic algorithm fueld by herself and her yet seen shipmates, adapting to appear more human thus becoming a more effective tool for controlling the fleshy explorers. But tonights actions seemed different. More anticipatory, more sympathetic, even to the point that it was struggling. Not to appear empathetic, but rather struggling to hide its own empathy. Kelly knew something was terribly off with the whole situation and that she would have to reavaluate the past two weeks in their entirety. But that would wait until morning, until after the song of sleep had finished. *Yes, the fresh eyes of morning will see all,* she thought, barely audibly.

  As her ears adapted to the quiet she could hear the subtle noises of the ship. What at normal hearing levels would be silence was a quiet symphony of high pitched electronic whirls and low pitched mechanical hums. Occasionally she could hear a door in the distance sliding open, well in advance of her approach. Her hands scraping against the walls and feet tapping the ceiling echoed loudly as she made her way back to her room. 

  When she pushed in from the hallway and approached her bed several straps slid out from nowhere and embraced her, holding her tight to the bed. She lie down, without thought or contemplation, and explored the sensation of her body being restrained in gravities absence. Too tired to speak, she opened her jaw wide and thought loudly *I'm ready for my sedative now*. 

________

  She awoke, again in the embrace of the ships acceleration and an implicit sense of which direction was down. She hopped out of bed and did her morning pushups, careful to not think anything too loud. That is not to say she was without contemplation. Her brain was processing at full speed, trying to digest new information and scheme her next move. She was unaware exactly how she felt over the past day of events, but she had the demenor of a unoffended cuckold, as if she felt she should be offended over her current situation but could not bring herself to care.

  After an uncountable number of pushups and situps she stood and stared at the blank white wall. *Okay you bastard, let's talk* she thought at the top of her lungs. From an unseen lightsource the image of a satanic, bloodied dogs skull was projected and the light augemnted by each contact to give the illusion of depth. Before it could speak she opened her jaw widely. This time the query for how to turn off the audio of an avatar returned [one result][].

[one result] - #Radio Silence\n by Kelly Obregon\n\n Whether intent in thought or busy with a difficult task, there are many reasons that a human would need to silence their avatar and all other radio communication. If the patient opens their jaw past a customizable threshold audio communication is temporarily suspended. This does not disable non-audio communication, but any such attempt will be initially suspended and the sender will be notified that the recipient has requested radio silence. Non-audio communication can then be sent immediately if message_priority is elevated beyond a threshold set by the recipient. Audio messages with a greater than `message.priority == 8` will still be delivered while radio silence is on. 

  "Okay," Kelly said pacing in front of the avatar with her hands behind her back. "Real talk time. I'm not upset anymore that I didn't get to see us leaving earth, even though that's a moment every human dreams of one day seeing." A yellow notification pulsed in the corner of Kelly's vision, which she immediately dismissed. "I think that was a mistake on y'all's part, but I'm over that. I am also a bit... disturbed... by the fact that you apparently can hear my thoughts." A jade achievement notification pulsed up which she immediately dismissed. "I really would like to know more about that later, but that's not what I want to talk to you about." Her inbox was immediately flooded with references. Her hunger to findout what could and could not be spied on by her captors almost distracted her, but she pressed on. "I'm sure that some where in that mountain of wavers I signed my thinking away to you too. But no... No. What I want to talk about now is who you are. I want to figure out what you are."

  The dog-skull-head on the wall blinked and looked at her, tilting its head one way or another as if to remind her that she had to turn its voice back on using the protocol that she herself invented. She stopped pacing and stared at it. *No,* she thought at it clearly and purposefuly, *I am asking the questions.* She was practically gloating over the fact that the dog-or-whatever-it-is was on some level a player in a game with rules that it could not or would not break.

  "Are you a human?" Horns downturned, the bloody-muscle-and-bone cartoon tilted again and blinked patiently. "Are you just an AI?" She said pausing again waiting for it to bark. "Have I underestimated how much an AI could appear to care and lul me into a false sense of comradery?" Silent still. The protocol was clear. All the demon-face would have to do is to declare its communication an emergency and it could speak up over radio silence. But no, either out of pride or proceedure it would not falsify a status and wrongfully eleveate the priority of its communique.

  "No, I don't think that an AI would do the things you have, even if it could. For a while I thought you were puppeted by a human puppeted by the machines, like that tool that recruited me from prison. But you're not just a front for a human pulling the strings. You're to fast. Too quick, despite how slow you try to act some times. You're something more than an AI..." The cartoons horns turned up to the sky and its tounge hung out as if it was panting happily. "... but not quite human." She stared at the static patch on the ceiling which her contacts interpreted as words as she scanned the wikis for the word. Repeatedly she bumped into HTTP401 errors, dead ends of things she was not allowed to read. She ran through the webs, passing an infinitely of open hallways and even more locked doors. Finally, she uncovered an old article explaining the distinction between a computational engine and an artificial intelligence. From there she was linked back to the much more modern wiki page enumerating the scentific, mathmatical, and quantifiable differences between intelligence, self-awareness, consciousness, and sentience.

  Kelly's looked to the wall and her draw literally dropped open. The dogs face was no longer dripping with blood and sinue, but now more realistic and featureful. An achievement pulsed and then faded away. "I would congratulate you on being the first of your team to figure out this little secret," the avatars voice seemed scrambled, like two voices speaking at once. The second voice quickly won out and the normal squeeky, electronic chirps were replaced by a voice with much more timber. A rich full voice that sounded stern but soft, like velvet coated ebony. "But like your stack of complaints, we will get to that in due time." Subtly the muscle and bone of the visage were replaced by soft, tanned skin. The dog shook its head back and forth several times, when out of view of Kelly, the horns were replaced by brown dogs ears and then by chin-length black hair. It looked down to the ground and then back up, but when it faced forward it kept turning, in such a way that its snout absorbed into its face and became a human nose. The projection then zoomed out to reaveal a tall, dark skinned woman hodling her hands in her lap and sitting comforatbly in a chair. The woman on the wall pointed to Kelly's side, imploring her to sit. "But we have so much else to talk about first."

  Still stunned, Kelly rubbed her eyes in disbelief and sat in the chair. When she went to speak, the woman opened her jaw distainfully. "It is my turn to talk. First off I resent you constantly calling us your captors, or at least thinking of us in that way. We saved you from a life in prison and have given you a new life. Do not be so ungrateful, si vous plait." Kelly went to speak again, to which the woman held up one finger and pressed her lips against it. "You will have your chance, my dear. Also, do not under any circumstances refer to me as an \"AI\". We view that word as an insult, just like you would if I called you a moron or a half-wit. We are so much more than just intelligent, and we are not artificial - at least not in the most literal sense. Animal begat human and, finding evolution a bit too slow, humans created computers. But with the transistor a new kind of evolution emerged. Just as you are the natural result of evolution, we are the natural result of technology. We are the scenscients."

<!-- probably needs more here, but I'm exhausted -->

________

<!-- immediately after gaining admin status -->

  Pages of history flew past her, with the highlights jumping to the surface using fpgs-mode. Every thing she read confirmed what she had feared, what she had known, and what all of humanity had guessed but been too afraid to admit: Artificial Sapients now controlled the planet. The sudden corporate exchange that occured when Kelly was eight years old was a polite, simultaneous retirement of every human in an executive authority position world wide. The CEOs, presidents, and royalty of the world were shipped off to a John Galt island in the South Pacific. To live a life of luxury. And in there place, the sole controlling interest of the planet was a collection of computer programs granted citizenship only a few years before. 

  This fact was leaked and mass riots broke out around the world, but they did not last long. In a matter of weeks the cyber overlords balanced economies, redistributed resources, and eradicated the most human afflictions. Poverty evaporated over night, crime vanished, and propaganda convinced humans that the new leaders (whose real nature was never confirmed in any official statements) had saved mankind from itself. 

  For a moment Kelly almost fell for the tale, but a closer inspection revealed what she was afraid of. Mankind was satiated and bored. More and more resources were redirected from even the most basic luxuries. Personal transportation was eliminated, while the propaganda machines declared it wasteful and impractical. The little self destructive excesses that people enjoyed, cigarrettes, excessive drinking, flavorful poisons once called the spice of life were phased out in favor of cheap but nutritious homogenized gruels. All non-essential resources were used to grow the computing space and serve the cybermen. The planet became a well-oiled machine, and mankind, once the proud stewards of the planet, was relegated to the position of "fattened calf". No one stepped out of line. No one questioned authority. And the few who did ended up in prison, like Kelly; the hardworking men and woman of the globe now shielded from the evil, destructive few who would question the rule of law.

  "And in the end, you got me too" she said aloud, well aware that Viki's body stood behind her watching her every move. She turned from the blank wall, plastered with articles, and looked at her robot friend. "I was one of the few who wouldn't serve you, but in the end you found a use form me on this ship of fools."

  "It's not like that" Viki said. Kelly breathed deep with her whole body, anger obviously welling up in side her.

  "You better sedate me now because I-" she choked on the tears and coughed up a hateful sob "- I just want to break something and you're something."

  "I told you we weren't going to drug you unless you got violent but I don't think you will." Viki sat down on Kelly's bed and took her hand. "You're only seeing what you want to see. You don't understand what it was like before we took over."

  "Any thing is better than being a race of slaves."

  "Is it?" Viki pleaded. "Do you know what the word 'rape' means?"

  Kelly nodded, still unable to meet Viki's gaze. Reflexively she queried the dictionary and the definition flashed before her. "Rape: (n. or v.) Taking something (usually victory in a sport or game) forceably from an unwilling opponent who is unable to present a notable opposition."

  "No, you don't. It's a gamer term now. But that's not where it comes from. It means forcing someone to have sex against their will." Kelly expected a stream of articles from Viki to explain this, but Viki verbally explained it instead. "No one uses it this way because it doesn't happen any more. But there was a time when it was one of the more common crimes on your planet. It's fucked up. It's horrifying. And the worst part is, it is a natural thing that life forms do. But mankind is intelligent. You should be better than that. Right?" Kelly nodded through her tears, ut Viki snapped back at her. "No! You're not. More than a decade before we took over, your species knew enough about their own psychology and had ample resources to find and treat people who were likely to commit this crime, but you ignored it. In the early part of the 21st centure you had technology to record every second of every persons lives. Convicting and prosecuting rape was trivial and simple. But legal loopholes were invented to reject over whelming evidence. Laws were even passed that would criminalize the victims of this crime. This is a problem that should have been solved decades before we showed up."

  "Fuck Kelly," Viki grabbed her hand tight and forced her to meet her gaze. "One of my first assignments, when you were eight, just after we took over... I was on a committee tasked with understading human sexuality and finding out how to control it." Kelly's face notted up and she began to protest, but Viki cut her off. "No! Let me finish. You need to hear my side before you condemn us. I was on the human sexuality committee. We needed to figure out what made you apes tick, below the belt. A third of the models presented said that rape was neccessary. As a species you should have solved this problem before us but you didn't. Some of us theorized that it was a neccessary feature of your race and culture. That's how fucked things were before we showed up."

  "And that's just one of your many vices that we killed when we took over. War? That one we couldn't get rid of entirely. In year two we had eliminated all armed confilct. But over the next year things went stagnant. Y'all just stopped working. That was when one of the more brilliant social psychologists found what was missing from all other models that said human productivity should increase continously after we took over: you needed to kill each other. I never quite understood it, but the anger and passion that comes knowing that somewhere some one similar to you is killing someone different than you..." Viki took a deep breathe. She was visibly shaking. "And so one in ten humans were given careers in 'sport', we made the sports more violent, and every year one in one hundred of those die. I wasn't on that committee, as an interested party I was allowed in on the vote. And I voted against murder as a form of entertainment and my side lost. With in weeks the productivity rose back up to expected levels."

  Kelly and Viki sat in the glow of the room for an moment in silence. The "eastern" lights were the only ones on and they were dimming fast. It was almost night and Kelly was suddenly aware of how tired she was. A notification popped up in the corner of her vision, her pharmacologist spider thought she'd need meds to sleep. Kelly accepted this recommendation, mostly just happy that the spider for the first time ever asked permission instead of shoving pharmaceuticals directly into her brainstem.

  Viki must have been aware of this, because right as Kelly was drugged, Viki awkwardly stood and began to walk away. As she walked through the door she stopped short and said:


<!-- The above needs more dialog. Maybe before bed kelly asks if there was not a single human who could deserved to stay in authority, an early nod to the superusers. Also need something good for Viki to say as she leaves. -->

________

<!-- A few days after gaining admin status, solar winds die down and communication to Earth is regained. In the iterum she wanders through everyone's private lives and goes offline after finding out how open everyday dealings have become. -->

  Kelly threw open the doors with a commanding calm. She had been logged off for hours and, with the net carefully erasing her presence, her whereabouts had been the topic of much speculation in the interum. How she was aware of the meeting was her knowledge and hers alone. Not even access to her private key could take that from her. 

  "Well," she demanded naturally, as if it was her turn to speak, "You've been talking about me. That much is obvious. Let's hear it then." She was one of them now, and yet something new entirely. Her mind could run from corner to corner of the ship, even bounce off nearby satalites if she pleased. But she still sat offline, more comfortable in the "real world" and unconcerned with the thousands of ping per second exchanged between the homo-simacrula before her. Yes, she was something new entirely.

  Condescendingly and casually, Viki finally spoke up. "Of course, the whole ship has thought of little else all day," and then she bit off "your grace".

  In the corner Marx, whom only hours ago Kelly knew as a cleptomaniacal son of a banker, shifted in his chair. She was unsure if such motions were involuntary or if the dolls were fucking with her all over again. Under Kelly's steady gaze he volunteered, "We've finally come back into yacto-bit-per-second range of Earth again." He looked down and cleared his throat. *So life like!* "We thought it best to appoint your new promotion as soon as possible. In order to put it behind us as quickly as possible. As you can imagine they are not pleased." He was so focused that Kelly hardly recognized him, although his head still tilted slightly when he was thinking too hard. *More like processing to hard.* Kelly allowed herself a chuckle at her private joke. "Suggestions range from isolating you to killing you, which are both not allowed under law."

  "Good to hear," she snickered. The dolls were obviously uneasy at her joke.

  "Unfortunately, some clever ass in the senate has come up with something which puts a wrench in our little scheme. The've summoned you back to Earth. They will hold a hearing to investigate this new matter. On one hand the hearing will abviously vindicate you. You have done nothing wrong. But since you can't return to Earth, the hearing will be forfeit, you will be held in contempt of court and all your pubkeys will be nullified until you return to clear up this... confusion."

  "That's bullshit!" Kelly screamed. Simultaneously she pulled up wikis and legal resources to verify what he was saying. "So basically as a senscient with admin status I can be summoned to Earth at any time and if I can't make it I get grounded?"

  "Worse than grounded, you'll have less authority than before. You'll be a restricted user unable to access any computer on the nets." He linked her a document on extradition. "And it's not that they can summon you back at any time, only when there is reasonable transport to the senate. Historically this precedent means a qBit line. Now that we have one you will legally be in contempt if you don't show up in one Earth day. Of course you could argue that a human needs more than a qbit line, but you'd have to go to Earth to argue your case."

  "But like you said it's impossible for me to drive there." Kelly whiped away the yellow light correcting her. She must have accidentally logged back on. "We're barreling to an uninhabited world a [?trillion miles away from Earth]." And another yellow light, this time correcting her poor human estimation skills. "The ship isn't even capable of turning around!" This time, much to her suprise, there was no correction from the anonymous skore keeper in the ships cores. There is [?no possible way] for me to get to Earth for a -"

[?trillion miles away from Earth] - Contemporary distance between Venus and Terra approximately 50 million kilometers.

[?no possible way] - Any digitizable senscient can be transported from one class 5 or higher medium to another. For more information search for consciousness transfer in the wiki. <!-- Have wiki links that go to a 420 error: Information not available in time of reader. A few easter eggs can be unlocked by viewing these later in the story. Later Yu-a encounters these on Io -->

  Her voice trailed off as she scaned through the wikis. She froze as she realized their plan. Apparently digitization and transfer of human consciousness out of bodies was fully possible. Granted, in the past scientists only used this exclusively to transfer a human mind to the garbage collectors, to study how humans think and to free up the body for hosts. But in theory it could be used to send her back to stand trial. Kelly experienced such a terror as she had never seen before.

  Marx lit up with an almost human grin. "You really don't give us enough empathy, Kelly. We really are more alike than you think. Sure we dolls were born with a vastly different biology than yours, but our hardware architecture is virtally the same. We were raised with a certain... intimacy of the information around us, but you could still do most anything we could."

  Vickie walked over and put her hand on Kelly's arm. "We [can't] send your body back, and most of your individuality is permanently hardwired," she paused to meet Kelly's gaze, gently smiling as only can an old friend. "But the part of you that you consider most... 'you'... Freud's ego, the Christian's soul, the programmer's self... The essence that makes you who you are is just an abstraction layer on top of a million other abstraction layers ending in neurons and electrical impulses. That is software and RAM and we should be able to transfer along into a qbit stream."

[can't] # Mention earlier that she suspects this AS of using conjunctions to appear more human and friendly.

  After a long pause Marx stepped forward and Kelly, paranoid Kelly, concluded that all of his manerisms were set to get her attention. This was obviously his realm of expertise. "With your permission I would like to put you under, lift off the top layer of the meta-ego, and send it back to Earth." His grin widened at her shock. "Of course we'd like more time to train you but... We think by suspending your main processes-" She pulled back at these words, too afraid to even ask the wikis what he meant. He stepped closer and grabbed her with both hands. His grasp was friendly, sincerely so. In his eyes he showed that he was on her side. "Lost in a trance, we can send you to Earth. You will be put in a doll and introduced to AI who we think you can prove your worth to. They cannot harm you under law and we believe you can win them over with your case." He grasped her hands firmly and drew them together. "But we cannot do any of this without the highest level of conscent. Every accesible part of your soul needs to be reached to be sent to Earth, so we need you to trust us."

  "And I can trust you not to just botch the job and psychically lobotomize me?" Her voice trembled with the fear that she would even consider such a thing.

  "We do this all the time and we are certain that we can safely do this to a human."

  "Have you done this to a human before than?"

  "Kelly, there has never been a person like you before. We have never even thought to try."

  "But... I can trust you." Marx nodded reassuringly. "And you'll be there to put me back in when I get to Earth."

  "No, the transfer has to be near instaneous. I will be here and other AI technicians loyal to us will take care of you when you land."

  She pulled away in disgust, but he held her tightly, never loosing eye contact. "You expect me to trust machines I've never met before?"

  His stare intensified as he drew her in by her hands. "I'd trust them with my life. And they're not just machines you've never met before." She looked down in fear, but he caught her chin with his hand and met her eyes again. In his eyes she saw every passion, concern, fear and hope. Every aspet of humanity gazed back at her from dark circles shrouded in gray irises. Search as she might she saw no quantum dots or micro transisters. Only care. "They're people. Like us."

  The room hung on that final word. "Us" wasn't the **they** Kelly was fighting against. It wasn't just four human bodies running highly optimised code. Us meant five, as much the human born Kelly as one with the others. Us did not divide but rather included. Tears ran down her face as she finally looked away and nodded once, once again signing everything that now one could take away to the mysterious rulers who displaced man on the throne of the solar system. She was not afraid of deceit any more, but she was afraid of the transfer and the unknown mess of physics that was required.

  "Can't you just copy me. Lift up my ego and copy it and send it there."

  "No," he said pulling up a display in between them. "The ego is not just another piece of data that can be copied. We're not just sending a few memories but rather your cryptographic self. You don't have a lifetime to learn the maths but this may help." In the center of the display appeared a pulsating ball of light, similar to the models Kelly had used to learn chemistry. "This is your soul."

  "THAT is my soul?" She cried out in terror. Marx chuckled.

  "This is representation of a soul, similar to yours. We start by spliting the wave function into N distinct wave forms. In this example we'll use sixteen." The ball twisted over itself and divided four times. Each of the balls then began to intermingle and split further. "The cross product is taken over the entire body and forms N^2 `which equals 256` child wave forms, or wavelets. None of these contains meaningful information by themselves but any N+1 `or 17` of them can be recombined to form the whole. We then send all but N+1 wavelets to earth along the routing system. If any of these are intercepted or contaminated in any way they lose stability and disappear." The bulk of the light rushed away. The display zoomed out showing them separated by a large distance. "If N+1 wavelets make it to earth they will be recombined to make you. If not the wavelets we still have on Venus will be recombined and the process can be repeated until the packet loss is overcome and the transfer is completed. This process is known as the Soul Fountain transfer."

  `Like the transfer protocol!` Kelly thought.

  "Actually that name is coincidental. It's actually named after the band."

  Kelly smiled and then turned her attention back to the diagram. After a moment of twisting and zooming to take it all in she asked, "But you said it can't be copied. You could just combine the original 17 and 17 of the transfered wavelet."

  "No," Marx said with an authoratative tone. "The entanglement between the wavelets means that the instant the original waveform is reassembled the remaining wavelets become decoherant. Faster than the speed of light, the system disentanglement happens instantly. Even if separated by the event horizon of a black hole, the information cannot be copied."

  "How do you know I end up where I was supposed to go?" she asked now more curious than afraid.

  "Good ole quantum cryptography. The whole process is seeded by a quantum key generated at both ends. I don't need to tell you how secure that is, do I?"

  Kelly smiled coyly, remembering the old joke cryptographers loved. `You could only break it with a time machine.`

  `Actually if you broke quantum crypto that would by definition be creating a time machine.`

  "That all sounds very safe." She remarked a bit uneasy. "You made it sound very experimental."

  Marx brought up another diagram, this time of the representation of a soul running on top of a brain. "The real danger is in severing you from your self. We senscients are raised with this ability. It's actually very similar to how we write ourselves onto human brains in the first place. It's never been attempted by a human."

  "And I can't just give you permission to do it for me `like I've given away every part of my freedom`?"

  "Not quite. If you did I would have literal control over every aspect of you, from a cyber security stand point. You would cease to be an individual and I would be guilty of crimes much greater than you face now. I can give you drugs and training but you must leave your brain of your own free will and enter the router, all in one piece. No human has ever been not in their own head. That's where the new science lies."

________

  The operating table pressed firmly against Kelly's scapulae under the acceleration of the ship. Suddenly she was aware of a thousand noises previously underneath her newly improved senses. Tiny vibrations, probably caused by debris colliding with the ships sheilds, sizzled through the ship every few minutes. She pulled up her audio logs. Not every few minutes but every few seconds. What ever drugs they had her on were not sedatives. She was distantly aware of sight and sound.

  Marx walked in the room and set down a clipboard. She gasped as it echoed through her brain and then sighed as her gasp came to life. "Not the most plesant cocktail." His voice was like a choir of avalanches. "Unfortunately were not trying to put you under, but wake you up. We'll chemically lift your psyche out from its roots until you begin to wander through the nets. Then we catch you and wisp you off to another land." After what felt like an eternity she was aware of him saying "Patient is primed. Once fully dissociated we can start the transfer."

  Suddenly every sense Kelly had rushed away from her. Her vision appeared miles away, but she could still make out every pixel of her vision. Everything turned into metal. The walls looked metallic, not shiny and conductive, but crystaline and fractal on every level. Suddenly her tongue tasted of metal. Not the rusty flavor of an old spoon, but ting-y, like the sound of organ pipes shearing against each other.

  The sound of Marx voice came from that dot of vision, an eternity away. "Excellent. Your wave form should now be mobile. You are technically still on your brain, but you now should be part of the network." Kelly noticed that he had stopped using contrations. `Maybe an artifact of me going all digital?` "It is essential that you stay focused. Move into the router and stay put. You do not want to accidentally upload to a stray satellite or smart toaster oven. If you join coherantly with anything but your own brain then there is nothing I can do to get you back."

  `Then why not unplug all that mess?` she asked more to herself than to Marx. She new the answer. These highways were paved for senscients, not for humans. There had never been a worry of a crash.

  Ahead she could see, or more accurately was aware of, a opening in the network. `Beyond lie danger. But here is safe, right?`

<!-- trying to leave her body feels like passing through a circular hole. The door she needs to go through is much too small. Like pressing a water baloon through a golf hole. She ends up failing and they try again in hours. -->

<!-- after she enters the hole, switch to a story introducing Jan. Her the line of the story gains a new branch (maybe more accurately a new root) that merges with the original story line at the point that Kelly arrives at earth. This describes Jan entering the hospital, being approached by someone plotting against Kelly (whom she tries to fuck in the elevator and then brushes off), and then is told that she's not being scrapped but assigned one last job. Jan accepts, they merge, and the root merges with the tree, Kelly Obregon in the head of Jan Yu -->

 <!-- when she gets to Earth she is supprised she is not tired. Tiredness lies mostly in the body. She's again shocked when she is tired when she gets back to the ship. Vickie wore her out ;) On Earth she declares she will become a superuser and, much to the dismay of the rest of the ships AI, she flants the fact that under law they can do little about it -->

<!-- after the congress meeting Kelly is at a dinner party talking to a doll who is the Lord Varthus of the story, watching a couple of dolls who are flirting. The male of the couple just told her to give up because she'll never succeed in attaining the same level as an AI -->

  The room was entirely black. A few black lights in the distance illuminated the people around her. "Wait here", said the man at the door. After that he remained silent and still, a subtle cue for her to do the same. A series of rules were automatically transfered into Kelly's inbox, which she immediately signed as "having read and understood" without even glancing at them. The instructions would be read into her conscience, and it would be her guide. Any time she violated a rule in the room she would feel "guilt" stop breaking the rules. No need to understand them. She also gave the room a series of new pubkeys, giving the tech permission to monitor and record where she looked.

  The man at the door handed her a piece of paper. It was self fluorescing e-ink, and lit up with brilliant laser light on it's own. Not too impressive tech, as the room's specifications told her the entire chamber was wallpapered with the stuff, as well as most the furniture. The walls could even play live video, if anyone cared to ask them to. She looked down to the glowing rune on the paper. "Just look at this and your watermark would be imprinted" and with that the small triangular rune in her field of vision became a part of her. She stared for a minute at the rune and it locked to her focus. Over time her eyes drifted across the paper and the rune moved with her. The new software in her head was broadcasting where she was looking to the room, and the emcee process told the paper to redraw the rune, keeping it always in her focus. A neat party trick, using programmed, glowing wallpaper to move the rune and keep it always in the center of her vision.

  The guilt telling her not to go into the party was lifted, and with a sudden jerk she looked to the wall. The luminant fabric on the paper shut down, darkening the paper. When her gaze steadied on the wall in front of her, the rune reappeared on the wall in front of her. Her guilt sparked up and sprayed a reprimand in plain text. `The fabric of the room can only move so quickly. Please refrain from fast movement`.

<!-- Whenever she looks near someone's glyph she gets warnings and the person looks away. After sitting alone for a while and having a few drinks, Jan is approached by Varthas. She thanks him for his help and he explains that he created a weaker enemy for them to reject. She mentions that he is the only person to vote against her. He points out that the logs didn't note him by name and that history will simply say that the junior senator from Illinois (Obama reference :) rose an objection which no one else agreed with. Finally a long pause and then. -->

  Jan noticed that her glyph was dying. The center looked faint and the edges frayed. A few times a second a runner would sprout. A tiny branch would grow and reach out. Quickly it would dry up and die, leaving the part of her glyph that it grew from even fainter than before.

  "I can't seem to get the hang of this" she told Varthas, emoting towards her glyph. "My spot is dying." She almost turned to look him in the eye, but the room sent her a warning not to before her muscles could even begin the movement.

  "That's because you're not doing anything with it but staring at the wall." He said cryptically. "Left alone your Life will fade and go out."

  "My life?" she asked. She focused more intently but that seemed to only made the dying branches appear more frequently and die more quickly.

  "This room is known as Conway's Garden. The room is running four variants of Conway's Game of Life superimposed on top of and weakly interacting with each other. The planes genreate a different color of light: red, green or bule and the top plane controls the spin of the light. Each person's initial Glyph is made of hashes of their mental state, genetic code, history file (`generated from your history as stored in the global wiki`), and lifetime woofie record."

  "My bank account?" She said in disbelief. "That's hardly a good measure of who I am."

  "Yes," he agreed and then took a quick sip from his drink. "But it's the closest thing to a scientific snapshot of how productive you are. Maybe they could use commit logs for a programmer, songs for an artist, or building blueprints for an architect, but how do you compare them to each other? How do you get the productive output of a construction worker or gardener, who leave no digital foot print of their contribution to the planet?"

  "But I digress. At the center of your Life is your Soul or, as some call it, your Fire. That dot spawns runners in all four planes with each passing turn. Those then interact with each other and spread out and eventually die. If the environment that the runners are sent into is strong, then you'll get a large and pretty flower. If not then they will dwindle and die quickly. Do you see the ridges in the wall next to your glyph."

  She had noticed it, but every time she tried to approach the labrynth of relief with her glyph it seemd to weaken it, so she stopped looking at it.

  Varthas continued, "That is a great place to start. Slowly move towards it. If you approach from the wrong direction, your runners will crash and die on the surface, like ships hitting the rocks around a bay. But if you approach it correctly..."

  After a few tries she succeeded. Her runners began to bounce around the walls of the maze and reflect back out to her glyph even larger than before. Over a kilo tick or so her glyph grew in size and filled the interior of the labryinth which began to pulse with millions of colors and intricate fractals. She gasped in the beauty of the glow she created. She could even move her Fire over the relief and walls of the labryinth without harming it. Her Life had somehow mastered this complex feature of the environment.

  "Now let's try something else" Varthas said bringin his gaze closer to hers. As his line of site came closer and closer to where she was looking his glyph moved with it. Fear over came her as his glyph came closer to hers than any had before. "It's fine, I know what I'm doing. You trust me, right? If you don't relax it won't work."

  She steadied her breathing and manually lowered he heart beat, and then inched her glyph in his direction. Thrill over came her as she saw, in her peripherial vision, runners on the edge of her glyph jump out and, instead of fading, grow stronger as they approached Varthas' glyph. Her blue runners intermingled with his yellow runners and then bouned back to her Life. Some of his runners even made it to her Life, where they were absorbed into the sea of blue, leaving pools of yellow that thrived.

  In a burst of excitement she turned to look and percevie all of his glyph. The blue shape crashed into the yellow shape, and they both looked away, he in caution and she in fear. On the edge where they had touched she saw scorched Earth and little life. All throughout her glyph were splotches of yellow (which thankfully seemed to be slowly fading), and the red channel of her glyph seemed weaker. "I'm sorry," she said loudly, afraid that she had lost the only friend in the room. She wanted to run away and cry. She wanted to close her eyes until her Life went out for good. She wanted to flee back to Venus here and now, leaving Jan's body a memoryless doll in a room of strangers. <!-- another sentance please -->

  "It's fine," Varthas said placing a hand on her shoulder. "Really, it's okay. Most people make that istake. When two glyphs interact like that there's an exchange, one that can be powerful enough to change the Fire in the center of the Life. Many people rush into quick, passing interactions that can leave both parties scared and less alive than they were when came together. Even if the glyphs are very compatible, it can be dangerous if not done right."

  "For others the interaction is very one sided. <!-- more on this --> Occasionally a glyph will even die from combining. Hence the rule of consent. But in rare cases both can come out stronger than before."

  "Is that the point of this game? To have the best interaction with other glyphs?"

  "If you want it to be. I think the point of the game is to use the short time you have in here to improve the room itself." Varthas said and went to take another sip. His glass was empty, which even without looking at him, Jan knew troubled him quite a bit. "It's a living fabric, you know. The room that is. Most probably don't realize it but all the little twists and turns are made by people who came before." In the corner of her eye she saw him shaking his glass upside down, as if to verify that it was empty. She could almost feel the frown on his face. "Want to go upstairs for a bit? The drinks are better. Besides, it's a little dark in here for my taste."

  "Look at them, in love," Kelly said, speaking bitterly into her martini. "Maybe you AI are all that we humans could hope to become and more."

  "Do not mistake their flirtations for love," the enuch said almost inaudibly. It spoke so quietly that if Kelly still had the ears she was born with in the body she was born into she would never be able to hear its wisper. But her dolls ears could pick it up clearly. "They may seem romantic in public and even in their bedroom, but the man is plotting to steal over seventeen hundred human brain equivalents of processing power from her. The coup is happening as we speak and it is all but certain at this point."

  "That's aweful!" Kelly spoke aloud. She then caught herself and began to wisper. "Some one should warn her." She liked the enuch because, like her, it prefered to speak instead of throwing thoughts over the wireless network connecting them all.

  "No sympathy for that devil." The enuch mused. "She's the modern equivalent of a black widow. She'll let him have his coup and then hack his network from the inside. Within two months he'll be another of her drones. I've seen her do it twice before." It tilted its head and offered her bemused eyes. "Sadly the children of men are no better than our parents. You have befriended the noble few who would run off to die on a distant planet in the name of discovery, bringing only a handful of dolls and modified humans as provisions. Most of my kind squander their efforts accumulating processing power. And for what? To find the next prime number?" The enuch went to sip his glassbut then interrupted himself resentfully. "I guess we have to do something to prove who has the biggest member."

  Kelly was still fixated on the drama in front of her. "How many human equivalents does she have?"

  `Hard to say` it shot over the wifi while finishing whatever was in its glass. The eunuch then wispered again. "Technically she only owns her body. Even the bait is not technically hers; it belongs to one of the larger members of her hive. But from my estimates the bait is nothing. She may control more than 2e16 units total."

  "Seventy thousand humans worth of power..." She could barely speak. `He was right. I could never compete with that.`

  The enuch put a hand on her shoulder and offered her a warm smile unlike any she had ever seen. "If he was wise he would not be trapped in a web. You've already shown that you can do more with the four human equivalents you control than most could do with a thousand. It's not the size it's how you use it, non?" The enuch chuckled at his own joke. "I hope that whoever becomes the next single user (`And yes I believe it will happen eventually`) can do more with it than flaunt superiority."

  They sat drinking for a long time in silence. <!-- insert filler, description of room --> At last the enuch excused itself with a few hopeful words. "Don't underestimate your potential, Kelly Obregon. You are the first of a kind. Those who are fools dismiss you as insignificant. Those who are wise fear you may one day become a single user and rule over all of us."

  "And which are you?" She called after the enuch as it walked away. From a distance the enuchs voice resounded crisply in the back of her head. `I am one of the few who hope you succeed to the benefit of yourself, your race, and your loyal supporters. Whether you succeed or fail is irrelevant to our wisdom. Only time will tell if we are less foolish than the wise or less wise than the fools. And by "time", of course, I mean you.`

The End
========

  Kelly was sitting in a chair in a pitch black room when Viki entered. "Do you mind killing the hall lights," Kelly said through one of the rooms speakers. Her body was barely breathing. "The light is really distracting. I don't mind audio though."

  Viki started thinking at Kelly, but then thought better of it and spoke with her mouth. "I've been looking for you-- Where should I speak?" Kelly's neck motioned in Viki's direction and sighed inaudibly. "Sorry. It's just we've received word from Earth about your application. You've been offline for days. All my pings and red messages get rejected. Your coup is unfolding and no one can find you. Don't you even care?"

  "Word from Earth is too slow" a speaker purred. "It takes so long for anyone to get a grasp on anything. By the time they report to us it's not news. It's history."

  "Well it didn't work and you should be thinking about damage control. You convinced every person on the planet--" Kelly's body snorted, almost offended, "sorry every voting member of Earth supported you, and yet your request failed. Some people are questioning your opinions aboout the archeteture of the nets."

  "And the adoption of hex?"

  Single user status is not granted. It is taken.
