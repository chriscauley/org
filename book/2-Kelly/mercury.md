<!-- This deals primarily with Kelly's earth fork, Mina. She eventually becomes the primary ambassidor to Mercury -->
<!-- 8/15/15 Apparently at one point Jan was named Mina... funny. I am renaming her in the rest of the file but leaving the above unaltered. Mina would be a great name for a character in book 5 or 6 because it  sounds so Belmont-y -->

The first rule of the Dark Star is you do not talk about the Dark Star online.
The second rule of the Dark Star is you do not think about the Dark Star online.
The third rule of the Dark Star is you do not write anything about the Dark Star that can be retrived while online.

  `I have a business meeting in twenty minutes` Jan shot to Daniel. `I need you out of here by then`

  "You know" Daniel hollered from the living bathroom, "We can just yell at each other from accross the house like normal people."

  "Sorry," Jan apologized looking for her shirt. "Bad habbits die hard. Most my collegues don't even have bodies. I'm not used to talking."

  Still half naked Daniel strode accross the room and kissed her full on the mouth. "What exactly do you have to kick me out for? You've never quite told me what it is you do for work. You aren't a v-g head are you?"

  Jan smiled and kissed him again. "I wish. I do what I am, and what I am is host to a fork of a high level AI on the Venus mission."

  "Oh, so you're a doll? I had my suspicions."

  "Not quite." Jan tried not to be offended by this. She was technically trained as a doll, but what she did was one of a kind. "I permanately host a large portion of an AI in my brain."

  "Weird," he said with a gradeschool giggle. "Is she talking to you now?"

  She frowned again at his ignorance, but he just turned to the bathroom to continue dressing. He didn't seem to get that he was insulting her. "No, she is me. We're one person in here. Like a doll, but permanent. We share many memories and dreams and thought patterns. Since she, who is I, can't talk to people on earth directly I, who is she, maintain two copies of herself-slash-myself. One for here and one for there."

  `Have you ever met yourself?` he shot to her as he began to brush his teeth.

  "Face to face? Why would I want to! I don't see the point and it would be very confusing. At that distance our minds would link up and we'd be seeing out of each others eyes simultaneously. We'd have to turn off most of our conscious selves to stop from going mad."

  `I'd probably fuck myself.` She heard him spit into the sink and then say loudly, "I'm sure that's an achievement no one has ever unlocked!"

  `I guess there'd be nothing wrong with that in the traditional sense. We don't share any genetics.` And then, laughing to herself. `I do not have any... SHE does not have any any sexual nerves. She removed a lot of those fleshy bits. You know, for efficiency. Space travel doesn't have the luxuries we do.`

  Daniel walked into the room, fully clothed now, and watched her as she tied her shoes. "Gross. I don't think I could live without this" He grabbed his crotch and then grabbed her ass. `or this.`

  She pushed him away in disgust while doing her best to make the guesture appear playful. *Why are the hot ones always so fucking childish.* There was probably more of a causal link there than she would like to admit. She casually opened up her contacts and put a note next to Daniels entry. *This behavior might soon cost you a booty call.* But beneath his snarky remarks and childish actions she could tell he was genuinely curious, so she decided to correct his ignorance. "You don't seem to be getting this. She doesn't need to have sex because she has most of my memories. When I have sex-" (`don't you mean we?` he interjected, but she continued her sentance as if he hadn't) "-she receives the memories a few hours later. When our instances resync. These memories are replayed just as if they are for me. So just like I can go about my day sexually satified because I remember recently having sex, so can she."

  "So you're a porn star."

  "And we're broken up" she declared less than half jokingly and pushed him out the door. `Call me` He shot back after the door closed. She opted not to respond in the hopes that maybe it would tame him. *I should leave him on the hook for a few days... radio silence* but even as she thought these words she missed him.

  Smiling the warm smile that comes only with sore thighs she walked to the couch and lay down. She could feel the bites on her neck and the scratches on her back, which she pressed into the couch to make them hurt more. It felt good last night and this morning and it felt good to finally explain to another womb-born being who she was. Every day she walked the streets with memories of a distant planet rattling through her brain. She passed people accustomed to living in one body, in one world, on one planet, with one mind, unable to talk or relate to anyone. 

  And work was worse as she mingled with machines that never knew the simple joys of not existing in a million places at once. They take flesh for granted and burn through dolls like condoms. And they treated her as such, a vessel housing the voice they wanted to hear. "When you get back to Venus" or "Are you sure your core understands?" they saw her more as a terjanl than a being.

  Her thoughts were interrupted by an alarm telling her that the meeting would start soon. Jan hashed her thoughts and stored them for later brooding. She then opened her eyes and looked to the white light panel on the ceiling. She dimmed the light while simultaneously darkening her contacts until she got to a level that was relaxing on the eyes. The darkness then errupted into a flash of figures and data from her other half's work on Venus.

  <!-- I think this next bit is only available offline, and specifically if unlocked content came before -->

  *I'm needed on Mercury* came a thought from deep inside her. She quickly spun up two daemons. The first raced towards Daniel to explain that she was medically offline and would need him to supervise her as she did something dangerous. She needed a human to watch her and make sure she didn't choke on her own vommit, and, although she hardly knew him she trusted him. The second was much more complex and would cover her meeting with the physicists and venture capitalists of her morning meeting. If they thought of Jan Yu as the answering machine for Kelly Obregon then they deserved no better than the answering machine of the answering machine of Kelly Obregon.

The waiting room above Mercury
========

  A shocking change in sensation overtook her as her consciousness was dumped into a new brain and as a new consciousness was dumped into her brain. But there was only one brain, one mind, one "her" - the strange intermingling of one souls thoughts becoming one with the memories of anothers body. A "doll". She cringed as she thought the derogatory word which truly was the best word for the human living only as a host for souls leaving the alien Mercurial surface and preparing for the trip back to earth. `Wait, no, I have always prefered Hermit.`

  <!-- describe the sensations of reintegration. Shivering in warmth as you get used to temperature again. The odd sensation of having a "down". Sights which correlate to sounds and sounds behind you which you know, if you turned, could be confirmed by sights. "She" has no breasts or sex organs and has been a boy when occupied by a boys soul. -->

  She glanced around the room and marveled, once again at the strangeness of the room. It was completely novel but at the same time the only room she ever knew. She ran to the toilet and vomitted the thick silver liquid she had drank moments before solely for this purpose. What followed was like a conversation in one head, the thoughts of the mind comforted by the memories of the body.

  <!-- describe the room more, not unlike the sterile halls of the ship/colony on mercury. The room she starts out in is plain to avoid over stimulation and the first real stimulus is in the observatory below. -->

  Part of her ached to go back down to the surface and reexperience the mythic, fantastical life on the surface - inside the surface - of Mercury. But she knew she could not go there because she was still there, tunneling backwards in time to this very moment. At the same time she could not go back to Earth because she was also there, preparing for a conversation about engineering life on Venus that she would never participate in but remember nonetheless. Now her only task was to wait for the present her on Earth to leave and come to Mercury. In the mean time she had one task: remind her soul with what it feels like to be a person in meat-space so that when she returned - when the mind returned and the body remained - she would not suffer and remember the reintegration sickness she endured presently. And that reintegration sickness consisted primarily of drinking vomitting over and over again.

  `Do not talk about the Dark Star. Do not think about the Dark Star. Do not remember the Dark Star.` the body thought loudly for the mind to hear. She walked to the mirror, if you could call it "walking" in [0.1G][], and smiled when she saw how pretty she was. She ran her fingers through her new hair cut and smiled. This style was meant to be plain but comforting because she knew that a visiting soul would take comfort in seeing a well framed face with pretty features on the way back to Earth. And she was very pretty. She had symetrical features, soft white hair and gray eyes. She caught glimpse of orange-red freckles and chuckled. She only recently decided to add those as they would be the first thing of color her guests would see after leaving Mecury. She inspected and was not surprised at the sensation of both her finger touching her face and her face being touched by her finger. Instead she marvelled at the simplicity of tiny spots highlighting her otherwise neutral body. Bits of pigment under the skin serving no purporse other than to distract the new voice in her head from the otherwise bland but shocking experience. And she was as proud as she was amazed. It was a nice touch.

[0.1g] #Definitely need to reseach the orbital physics of such a satellite.

  Leaving the mirror she descended a latter toward Mercury, her body very well accustomed to the gentle pushes and pulls of moving through a rotating body. When she reached the bottom gravity was noticeably larger (and luckily she found another toilet to vomit into and another bottle of the liquid waiting to speed her recovery). The floor here was transparent, familiar and novel, and she could see the surface of Mercury illuminated by the sun. She gasped in amazement as flash of light streaked across the surface at a mostly constant lattitude and then remembered that each streak of light, occurring dozens of times every Earth hour, was another soul like herself, rushing through time accross the strange physics of Mercury's time engine. The soul moved backwards in time as she had, and then would be spit back out into meat-space, as she had, into another doll like her self, tasked solely with reintegration.

  The part of her which was Jan felt sorry for the nameless [Hermit] she now inhabited. She would never meet another body in the flesh even though the satellite she lived in was housed with many such dolls. There could be dozens of such satellites (the body confessed it did not know) which Jan may someday see on return trips to Mercury but the Hermit would not. But the body reassured and comforted herself that her existence was not lonely. She would come to know many thousands of people in her lifetime. She would be many thousands of people in her lifetime and she would remember being each one while they would not.

[Hermit] #A good name for the people of Mercury because it sounds like Hermes.

  The false moons rotation moved the surface of the planet towards the horzon. The transparent floor tinted and darkened until the planets surface and the stary backdrop was hidden from view. And then, when the room was fully taken by shadow, the sun rose from the leading edge of the floor. She gasped at the site, one that the body never tired of and never fully got used to. The brilliant ball grew out of the reverse horizon, four times as large as on Earth. Through the filters and tinting of the floor she could look at it planely and make out sunspots and the waves of lava. She saw the sheen of the corona and the majesty of the photosphere. Awe over took her as it never had before - as it had every day - as she saw the surface knot up and snap, releasing and then relaxing via prominence. A moutain worth of plasma blown into space and becoming one with the vacuum.

<-- much more sun and surface of mercury should be written above -->

  After a time, Jan yawned and the doll knew her brief time was up. She no longer felt the urge to vomit every time as she was now reaccustomed to being once more in a body. She was no longer aware of every inch of skin and as she moved she was no longer consumed by the momentum change of her limbs. The bedroom was now illuminated in soothing colors and dream like textures. She drank another type of liquid, this one a opalescent magenta, as she walked back to the bed she awoke in. Conflicting emotions of sorrow and hope over took her as she mentally prepared to separate self from self - Jan sad to leave this new and wonderful world and the doll excited by whom she may become next. In seconds the doll would become an unthinking vessel ready to host another transiting soul and Jan would be on her way back to earth with no memories of her night on Mercury and her day in the sun. But as they uncoupled the Hermit thought something towards Jan. One last thought to take with her back to her old life. "I live a life like no other. It's not so bad, being a doll."
