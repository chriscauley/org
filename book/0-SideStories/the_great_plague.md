  Potential idea for a short story during the great plague. Possibly discovered by Yu-a before she discovers the satellite mind. This is meant to reveal the deeper details of the plague (eg that it was designed specifically to die off after 4-5 transmissions, the indifferance of the computers to the problem). Also explores early attempts at dolls and other ways in which AS used plague victims as test subjects in massive medical/telepathic experiments.

  Main character (she, possibly in first person) starts getting into a car in a scene similar to opening of locked in. She notices how small the car is (only for 1 person). She thinks about staying away for the car ride, since her disease is a death sentance and she these may be her last moments. She feels apathetic (probably a symptom of all the drugs) and sleeps for the trip. 

  She wakes up in the hospital garage in a quarantine area. "The doctor", who she never actually sees and is hinted to just be one of "them" (the AS), congratulates her on not infecting anyone else and is happy that they covertly brought her in so as not to cause alarm (she was infected by the first case of the plague in her city). The doctor tells her that the drugs seem to be able to keep the symptoms at bay, but to date no one has survived the disease. She has her choice of two experiments (the doctors words for treatment). One is a highly dangerous vaccine with a 20% fatality rate (which half the world has already taken), the other a new proceedure that could back up her consciousness to the nets.

  She accepts the back up plan and the doctor immediately administers it to her, explaining that the coctail of symptom supressants she has been taking for the past week are coincidentally the same drugs needed to make her brain pliable and ready for the treatment (she is suspicious of this but once again doesn't really care about anything). She gets an injection at the base of her skull, which assembles a metal mesh thorughout her brain. She immediately gains a sense of terror, disoriented and feeling like she's experiencing the same thing twice at the same time, a kind of bi-directional de ja vous. The doctor assures her that the treatment is non-invasive and what she is actually feeling is the replication of her consciousness onto the nets. 

  (At some point in this we need a discussion of how transfering her to the nets will only capture her conscious thoughts. The whole point of this story is that we are actually only seeing her snapshot, which is reliving the brief window over and over again for all of time).

  The doctor says this new experiment qualifies her for another. This will be remote controlling an android like creature to go see her friends (yea, I wrote this right after reading Locked In, so sue me. The rest of the doll stuff was pre Locked In, and dolls are as old as SciFi). The android like creature will have a 20 ms delay and less sensory perception (no temperature or equilibrium) but will otherwise feel like her own self. She goes out to dinner, finding that her friends and family are already briefed on her circumstance. At first everything seems fine as they talk about anything but her (mostly about a new game meant to model the virus and how her brother set a new high score by giving the virus a time, as if the virus will die on its own in a year), but then one of her friends remarks how much the doll really does look like her. This depresses her because she realizes how little her friends seem phased by her fatal disease. She forces the doll to keep smiling (its muscles are almost entirely controlled autonomously since the delay would make walking impossible). Now that she's used to it she spends most of the evening on auto pilot, as unconcerned with her friends as they were of her.

  On coming out the doctor informs her that new information shows that much of what they thought was medicine beating the disease was actually the disease self destructing. This is based on another video game player who beat her brothers high score. People more than 30 generations (2^30 = 2 billion) from patient zero seem show much less symptoms and are actually surviving the disease. For people closer to patient zero medicine is useless. Luckily she is 32 generations away which means she has no chance of death. He says that discontinuing the medicine will make the mesh in her head toxic, and she chooses to pull it out rather than stay on mind numbing drugs. She asks if the snapshot will be destroyed and he says that it will be archived for future study. She hs no legal option to stop this.

  She leaves the hospital to go to another facility for the mesh removal. She contemplates that something isn't right and that the mesh should be able to be removed any where. When she brushes that away the doctor communicates to her (remotely) that the mesh will stop soon and she should not be disturbed when it does. As she gets into the car the story begins to lap itself. Hopefully by this point I've convinced the reader that they are reading the snapshot of her rather than her experiences. It's running on repeat in cyberspace, and invented the second car trip to reconcile the discontinuity of repeating over and over. 

  Another important theme to drive home is that the snapshot thing could be terrifying. For all she knows she may be copying her brain to then live in an eternal hell online. The doctor says that no such information or data is available to tell either way as this is a new technology and they haven't been able to probe the people living online. She compares it to "donating your soul" to science and thinks about how terrible that could be.

  She goes through with it any how, obviously. It's assumed because the drugs are so mind numbing, but it's also worth noting that her friends are also unsympathetic. With the AS having taken over ("them", as they are called through out this) people have everything provided to them which seems to have put all of mankind in a "satiated and stupid" mind set.
