Trip to Venus
========

  The first time Kelly tried to get out of bed she sat up too fast. Bolts of pain shot through her spine and all of her ribs. Her bones felt like they were on full of glass and every muscle felt like it was wrapped up tight in barbed wire. A thick fog filled her head and she blacked out before she hit the pillow.

  The second time she awoke she lay still, afraid to open her eyes. Days must have gone by unconscious because the pain had mostly subsided, yet she could still feel every needle they stuck into her spine and every bone they cut open. "What the hell did I sign up for?" she tried to say out loud but the words stuck in her dry mouth.

  Finally she opened her eyes and scaned the room. It was a sterile white with light seemingly coming from no where all at once. All of the walls remained featureless except one that was covered in barely noticeable drawers and pannels. In one corner, opposite the bed and door, was a small table with a contact case on it. 

  She sat up with another large all encompasing jolt of pain. Stumbling at first, she got to her feet. Suddenly the pain was gone, like a tight tangle of yarn that only need be stretched to be banished. `Not bad` she thought reevaluating her new quarters. `Much larger than a jail cell.` There were no windows, no building materials other than the white ceramoplastic, and no noises other than her own heart beating slower and stronger than ever.

  To test her new muscles she began doing push ups. A pleasant ache filled ran the length of her arms as she did ten then fifty then two hundred; several times more than ever before. She stopped when a subtle noise ran through the room. The rumble started at the ceiling and ran down the height of the room. The floor vibrated almost imperceptably under her fingertips. `The buildings mechanics`, she mused, `but why would you put the boiler room in the attic?`

  Defiantly she continued her routine of isometric exercises - the only way she knew to pass the time. What she was supposed to do was obvious. The eye contacts on the table were certainly the first step into her new life of servitude to the powers that now owned her body, her race, and all of the planet that humans had previously ruled undisputed for several thousand years. `They can wait. They will own me when I put those on but for now I am mine alone.` She effortlessly repeated her routine several times, then, with the pains of hunger setting in, she went back to bed to buy herself a few more hours of freedom.

________

  After sleeping, waking, and exercising for what felt like days, hunger overtook Kelly. She returned to the table with the eye contacts case, picked it up, rolled it around a few times in her hands, and put it back down. She did the same with the note on the table, but the only words written were "Instructions in eye contacts". `I guess not much else need be said` she thought. Contacts like these were as common as furniture now. Hell, her father had refused to use anything but email and chatter for most of her life. Even he had started wearing after the takeover.

  So she popped open the case and pressed the clear plastic into place over each eye ball. They were thin and unnoticeable and powered up almost instantly. `Spare no expense for the heros of tomorrow, I guess.` She chuckled bitterly at her own joke. The whole world would be watching as the scum of the planet colonized another world. A modern ship of fools; the brilliant and the expendable sent to their certain doom so that one day corporations could finally escape Earth and spread accross the solar system.

  She blinked through the modes of the eye contacts, even more impressed than before. IR, sub-IR, near UV, far UV, x-ray (seriously?), pan spectrum, edge detection, velocity estimation, content tagging, fast parse/grep/save... Kelly was impressed and that was not easy. She had used most of these prior to incarceration, but to always as separate contacts. Estimating the price of such a modern miracle, a wave of dissiness swept through her. Even lowballing it, she probably had several times her estimated pre-incarceration lifetime income resting gently on each eye ball. Two miniture fortunes for the express purpose of spraying [?laser light] and augmenting vision for little old her. 

[?laser light] - "contacts are actually passive, they function by tuning light that comes into the eye and do not produce any light."

  After she blinked back into vis-mode a green glow appeared in the corner of her eye. She immediately turned her whole body to invesigate, but the glow stayed fixed in the same spot in her vision. `Muggle move Kell` she scolded herself. `Has it really been so long?` She unfocused her eyes and begin and turned her eyes down toward the pulsing green light. It began to grow, filling her view field, ready to pop. Before the message opened she thought better, refocused, and the pulsing jade shrunk back down to a [dot][]. Green meant low priority. In actuality she was not required to ever read the message. She could even delete it. And if they made her rat in a cage she could rat back by not responding to their tests. Ignore the friendly notices and wait for the messages to become blue, yellow, red and evenually black.

[dot] # "Later she reflects on this and is happy she had the skill to close a message before opening it."

  She even thought to blink away the message, then decided to ignore it and fain ignorance. "Lights" she spoke, the first words from her mouth in days (months?). After a few moments the light faded to nothing. A small victory which she rewarded with more excercise and more sleep.

________

  It felt like hours passed waiting for the jade dot to appear, even though she knew that green notices would spool up a cron.30 once ignored. She tacitly counted the minute pulses. It had to have been at least an hour since she last dismissed it. Finally she blinked into cron-mode. It had in fact been an hour twenty since she last got notice. Were they testing her? Did **they** somehow sense her rebellion and decided to respond in kind?

  Finally the jade returned. Angrily she blinked it away and immediately regretted it. "Fuck!" she said under her breath. She was hungry. Not hungry enough to pull it up manually in [talk-mode], but still painfully hungry. After only seconds the dot reappeared, pulsed green once and then shifted to yellow. Warnings could not be dismissed and would have to be resolved to be removed. Her pride would remain intact; **They** must be in a good mood.

[talk-mode] # -mode for communcation, -cam for vision?

  She unfocused and pulled up the citrine message. "Yes?" she said indinantly, knowing full well that speaking to a message had no effect. Words rapidly filled her view, letter by letter.

\[\[Welcome and good morning. For more rapid communication a familiar will be generated. Blink to continue.\]\]

She focused on the blinking full cursor and blinked.

\[\[You will see a cycle of non-real images appear via eye contact and tacit response will be used to select the best familiar for you.\]\]

Blink!

\[\[If unfamiliar with eye contacts, this could be disturbing. Please ready yourself and blink twice to confirm.\]\]

  `They must really think I am a muggle.` She sat in the chair and looked at a wall. Suddenly a flash of pictures appeared in the white space, too quickly to recognize. As the cycle slowed she thought she saw a cat and grimiced at the idea of seeing **that** for weeks of training. The cycle continued. Dog, fox, wolf, some kind of hell knight, demonic robot; finally it settled on a dog skull with clown eyes and comical features. Both its horns were turned, right up, left down. Dull pink smoke drifted from its mouth as if the virtual creature was breathing. `Got to give the psyche bots credit`, she mused. `They know what I like!`

\[\[Familiar 0863xA3 selected. d-blink to accept. s-blink for manual selection.\]\]

  BlinkBlink!

\[\[For sufficient band rating audio permissions must be shared. d-blink to accept. Unfortunately rejection has been disabled for lack of persone-\]\]

  BlinkBlink!

  Again she became aware of the pain in her bones and thought back to the mountain of wavers she signed when accepting her sentence reduction. Full body marrow replacement, lung scraping, rights to chemical intake (wtf...), and the millions of phys-augs they did to her while comatose. Had they really forgotten to include the right to play sound in her ears?

  "Thank you and good morning!" the skull said, trilling over its words and spining in plane in front of her. "You have successfully unlocked familliar access and inner cochlear communication. Your rate of completion for this task is $THREE DAYS$, ranking you in the $ZEROTH PERCENTILE$." His last two words were spoken by a stale female voice. `And I thought they were high tech$ she thought`, realizing that everything said must be pre-recored for each avatar. She then gloated inwardly about her ranking. There were supposedly three hundred prisoners selected for the experiment. By comming in last she felt that she had some how won, as if a bonus acheivement should be awarded for having a percentile equal to the number of fucks given.

  "Please note that ratings are purely educational and will not be used to determine rank or pay. As you may have guessed, your current status of $LIVING$ indicates that you survived all of the physical augmentations necessary to undergo collonization. You may notice daily subtle alterations to the environment. This is to acclimate you to your destination." Both of the horns of the wall image became downturned and his jaws slacked as if frowning. "This may result in illness or death. But don't worry." The cartoon perked up, back-flipped, and wiggled his horns excitedly. "If the acceptable death rate is exceeded, the mission will be cancelled, your physiology will be returned to as earth-like as possible, and after a brief parol period you will be pardoned. If the mission is scrapped mid-flight, ExplorIncor cannot be held accountable for deaths during transit back to earth. Would you like to begin training as a $CUSTODIAL TECHNICIAN$?"

  "What!?" Kelly screemed, half conscious of the fact that she was screeming at non-senscient tutorial program. "I get busted for cracking the second largest security protocol, jailed for black-hatting, and then win the lottery to die some fucking rock a [?million fucking klicks][] away from home," an amber warning poped up to correct her math, which she angrily blinked away, "and my job is going to be space janitor?"

[?million fucking klicks] - Actual distance between Earth and Venus varies between 38 and 261 million kilometers. Unknown SI prefix "fucking" has been disregarded for this conversion.

  Skull head shuddered and shrank to a point. A second later he reinflated with a smile on his face. "The leaders of Explore Incor. would like to remind you that every job is important. We acknowledge your skill as a $BLACK HAT HACKER$ but feel your skills would be better served in another position." He shrank again and paused as if loading his next thought. What is powering this piece of junk? Transistors? Cassette tapes? "I mean, there aren't many $COMPUTERS$ for you to $BREAK INTO$ where we're going, do ya feel me?"

  She sulked, not breaking eye contact with the floating skull conjured on the wall. "And if I refuse?" she said in a threatening tone. Any person would have cowered at her quiet rage. Her piercing eyes and locked jaw had stared down parents, teachers, wardens, prisoners, and almost even frightened off the NSA agent who had arrester her. But this thing - a cartoon front for a pile of ones and zeros visible only to her alone via contacts - this thing would not be intimitated.

   "$ONE MATCHING QUERY FOUND$" the girl voice responed. Then he spoke again, gregarious as ever under her death stare. "Would you like to review the last time you asked this question, or to have the question re-evaluated for contextual changes?"

   She blinked twice and a green notification appeared. This time pulling it up caused a panel on the wall to glow. She walked over to it and as she neared a drawer slid out of the previously seemless wall. Inside were full immersion glasses, which she put on some hesitation. The message paged, and she found that a video had been placed in her box. Guided by instinct, she accessed the rooms API and dimmed the lights. The glasses lit up with unfocused light that her eye contacts focused and readjusted as she looked around the room. Looking at the edges of her vision, where the glasses did not project, the room was black as night.

  But looking ahead she saw the room fully lit, only now it was not her hospital room but the equally sterile interrogation room at the prison. She turned to her table, which was now the rectangular plastic table (complete with ash tray and coffee mug) from the prison. The glasses projected a man. Clean cut, nicely dressed and responsible looking. Normally Kelly would never look twice at such a tool, but this tool claimed to be her ticket out of prison. She looked at the table accross from the square and saw the back of an inmate. The inmate had a frail frame, now-greasy once-beautiful hair, and miraculously still soft skin. A lump appeared in Kelly's throat as she looked over the girls exposed arms. They were a galaxy of scars. Tiny pink ribbons from fights with other inmates. A large gash on her right shoulder from when she crashed her bike when she was eight. And a series of slowly healing lines at her wrists. Kelly walked up to the fantom in the chair and looked down at her simulacrum. It spoke with her own voice, weepy and tired but somehow not broken. "Why me?"

  The tool spoke confidently and matter of factly with all the sincerity and generosity you would expect from someone who wanted to offer you slavery in place of prison. "Well as you know Luna was colonized by prisoners. Exploration Incorporated, then a subsidiary of Twitter, first tried to send scientists and engineers, and the first wave failed because they were not able to handle the conditions so-"

  Kelly's ghost cut him off. "No, I mean why me specifically?" By this point real-life Kelly had walked around the table and was staring in disbelief at herself staring in disbelief at the suit. Still she could remember the confident smile he gave her at this point. That devil's grin was burnt into her memory; no need for full immersion glasses. 

  "Your prison files are public access and we know your dark past and the damage you caused. But we don't view this as a tendancy toward crime so much as a vast potential without a creative outlet. You'll most likely not even be hacking if you work for us. I mean, there aren't many computers for you to break into where you're going." He chuckled mechanically. "But we feel that once on Venus you'll rise to what ever challenge is put infront of you. Criminal turned superman."

  He asked the question very sincerely. But his charismatic grin only angered her then and the memory of it only angered her now. Kelly was no longer looking at her twin, now stewing accross the table, taking a drag from her cigarrette and trying to choose between taking The Man's offer or breaking the ash tray and using it to cut his throat. Real-life now-time Kelly now stared at the back of his projected head, tempted to scream all the things she wanted to scream now. No one would hear but Mr. Skullhead and her private log files, but that would still mean admitting to herself how much she cared. She knew at that point she was making a pact with the devil. She knew that by leaving jail she would never be free.

  "And if I refuse?" she mouthed the words along with her shade.

  Suit boy shrugged and raised his hands. "The choice is yours-" he began but she cut him off.

  "No I mean what if I don't play ball? What if I get there and decide the game isn't for me?" Real life Kelly blinked to pause and walked again behind herself. As she approached the table in the video the table she also approached the table in the real world, beyond the glasses. The a red outline of the "real world" table and chairs appeared as she approached. She sat down in the chair over top of her own image and placed her arm next to her own, lining the objects of the real and virtual world up as closely as she could. Old, simulated "her" was battered and weak, yet some how still strong in her resolve. The very resolve she would soon sign away in a million printed wavers. Now-time Kelly's arms had filled out and tonned. She matched posture perfectly with herself and she saw the infected mess of scars she tore open every time they let her out of solitary. But those scars were only on her double. What ever miracle treatment they had done to her wiped all her scars clean. She had risen from the cocoon a butterfly with un-marked wings.

  "What if I refuse?" real-world Kelly repeated and then blinked to play.

  The man smiled his adversarial grin. "It's the exact opposite of here. No cops, no wardens, no adults to whip your ass and send you to your room. No one but a few hundred cons further away from authority than mankind has ever been." He sat back gloating. "But at the same time, you have no choice but to play ball. It is the only game on."

________

  Kelly sat at the table, still shaking with rage over the images replayed as if from her own memory. Part of her rage was certainly reserved for the "government", whatever that was these days. But most of her hatred was caught up in her own self image. She agreed to this. She signed up. There was no one to blame for her lack of freedom other than herself.

  The googles went dark and the room lit up. When another panel opend up she almost fell over in her chair. The smell of food overcame her and resurrected her forgotten hunger. She lunged at the plate, all self consciousness forgotten. Face half burried in the best food she had ever tasted, she ate. 

________

  Full and calm now, Kelly sat up to put the tray back in the wall, her mouth still glowing with flavor. The taste bled into her sese of sight and touch. `I'm tripping balls` she thought. `They must have retooled my senses because... wow...` Tray gone, she went to the ground to resume sit ups. But the taste still pulsed in her mouth. Dizzy, she lay on the ground.

  Another green note lit up in the corner of her sight. This one she blinked on without hesitation, happy to her overlords for feeding her. `Cat's fed... This beast is tame. If you want to rub my belly now, I'd be totally into that.` Raw text lit up her vision, which she could still make out with eyes closed.

\[\[ Lesson one of Chemistry 1x01 added has been added to your repositories. d-blink to start. Otherwise you can recall any les-\]\]

BlinkBlink!

  "Hello again $KELLY$! I trust you enjoyed the meal" Mr. Skullhead said to her jovially. With her eyes closed there was only enough light reaching the contacts to show his outline against her eye lids. "It is actually recommended to complete the exercises lying down until youy get used to intrakinetic sensations, but you must keep your eyes focused on a white surface. Also maximum comfort is recommended so lying on the floor is not ideal. Would you please return to the bed?"

  She shrugged and stood up. But something seemed off. Skully's words were very specific to her situation. Could they really forsee such a situation and prerecord his words? Where was the generic woman voice. She made mental note to look into this further. Normally, the technophile that she was, she would put a reminder in her cron, but they surely had access to those.

  "Thank you," Skully responded when she got on the bed. "Your first lesson will focus on exposure to intrakinetic sensing. Because of your previous chemical education you have been advanced to $LEVEL ONE-EX$. Do you have any questions before we begin?" He was obviously baiting her for a query on intrakin-whatever-the-fuck, but she wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

  "Why does a space janitor need to know chemistry?" She asked coyly.

  "An excellent question, Kelly." He knew her name. Again the facade of the pre-recorded familiar was cracking. "Day to day janitorial maintainence is performed by spiders. You will focus on coming up with unique chemical clensing of the mess which is Venus. A custodial technician does is charged with repairing the destruction of equipment in the unique environment of Venus. Is my answer satisfactory or wou-"

  She cut him off. "If you brain bots are smart enough to rule mankind why can't you figure this crap out yourself?"

  "The organic or otherwise nature of the current Earth government is irrelevant." He paused and changed tone. "There are many unforseen avenues that we believe you may pursue that the greatest scientific minds may not have come up with. Had we been uncertain of this you would not have been selected. Is my answer sati-" BlinkBlink! "Excellent. Please stare at the image of hydrogen on the wall." A pulsing ball with a solid center appeared on the ceiling in front of her, replacing the talking, bleeding canine. "When you feel comfortable please d-blink to continue. A sensation similar to touch will be presented in your mi-"

  BlinkBlink! and she immediately regretted it. A new sense of touch, for lack of a better word, arose in her instantly, taking her breath away and making her forget to breathe. If she could control the beating of her heart it would have stopped too. The feeling wasn't infront of her or behind her or in one of her legs. It just hovered in a new dimension previously unknown. In the center was a single hard knot, isolated in a tiny spherical vaccuum. Then a hard edge sat a ways (centimeters? kilometers?) from the center and tapperd off spherically away from the origin. She couldn't feel where the electron cloud ended.

  She felt herself becoming less and less lucid as she began to breath again. "A sizeable dose of sedative has been administered in response to the panic you're experiencing. Also you have been given a sizeable dose of druuugs as part of the learning experience. Please note that this is in complete accordance to waver number -"

Blink... Blink!

  Skully chirped up triumphantly when she failed at performing a d-blink. She couldn't see him but some how she could feel him. `Intrakinesis` she thought. `Intra fucking kinesis` He spoke sympathetically. "Please focus on the lesson and let all messages finish on their own. I will give you a moment to adjust to this. No d-blinking is necessary since we are monitoring your vitals and can tell when you are ready to continue."

  She focused on the sensation of the hydrogen atom. The cloud pulsed excitedly. As she focused more heavily on the pulse of the electron she could feel its excitement like she could normally feel her own excitement. But as she did this the cloud widened erratically, and when she knew the exact momentum of the cloud it grew large enough to fill her entire universe. So she blurred and forgot about the momentum, focusing now on the boundary it exerted on reality. The cloud shrank to a two dimensional sphere, but she could no longer feel how excited it was. A green pulse lit up telling her she had unlocked an achievement. `Heisenburg, I'm sure I love you but I'm uncertain how much.` She giggled over her wit. These druuugs must be damn good.

  "Well done. Please explore the orbital and nuclear variations of Hydrogen [in your own time][]. Now we must explore the interaction of a two atom system. We could load this for you but would like to try on your own. Please unfocu-" She relaxed inhaled and focused on an empty space far away from the first atom. The empty space bubbled and a second hydrogen atom appeared on the wall and in her mind. "Excellent," Skully spoke as another achievement pulsed in the corner of her view. "You're now at the level of $INTRODUCTORY$ intrakinesis. You rank in the $NINETY-EIGHTH$ percentile on this achievement. Congratulations."

[in your own time] A homework reminder has been set. For more information please review your calendar.

  By this point she had both atoms twirling around each other. Pushing them about was easy enough, but as she moved them closer their clouds overlapped and an uncomfortable sensation was generated between them. `Activation energy` she thought. `Sure as fuck wished I'd paid more attention in chem now!` But it was still pretty obvious what she needed to do. She moved the atoms far apart, giggling the entire time under the influence of druuugs. She summoned all her focus and bounced them against each other at full speed. The atoms collided and then flung themselves apart violently. After a few tries they stuck, the clouds became one-but-still-two and enveloped the two nuclei together. She smiled and closed her eyes, feeling the nuclei vibrating gently together. Another acheivement pulsed as she drifted deeper into her own mind, trying to think of which atoms she could play with next.
